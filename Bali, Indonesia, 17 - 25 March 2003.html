<I>Island of carving</I> <BR>By Wendy<BR><BR>From the moment we stepped off the plane in Bali, the architecture of the island fascinated us.&nbsp; Most buildings, entrances, bridges etc. have carvings of guardians protecting them and nearly all towns have two ornate pillars as their entranceway.&nbsp; The colouring is usually quite bland – mostly rock and cement carvings – but not a feature is overlooked from individual scales on dragon’s backs to the teeth and fingernails of the gods and demons.&nbsp; As most people in Bali are Hindu, the carvings are most often of the elephant god Ganesh, of Shiva, or other important Hindu creatures (most abundantly: Barong).&nbsp; As soon as one leaves the beaches, the roads are lined by shop upon shop of stone carvers.&nbsp; Unfortunately, a nice little metre-high stone Ganesh carving would DEFINITELY make us overweight and neither of us cared for the idea of wandering the streets looking for accommodation with him on our back – so we will make do with only photo souvenirs.<BR><BR>To the North East of Bali’s capital, Denpasar, is a lovely little art town called Ubud.&nbsp; This town is like the Grahamstown of South Africa or the Chiang Mai of Thailand – there is an abundance of paintings, sculptures and live performances to overwhelm the senses.&nbsp; Ubud also has the sensory advantage of being set in amongst the rice paddies, that provide breathtakingly green (and sometimes yellow when the rice is ripe) views of fields, interlaced with fast-flowing streams and miniature cascades. &nbsp;<BR><BR>Whilst in Ubud we stayed in the Hibiscus Inn, a beautiful couple of rooms built in the middle of the rice paddies.&nbsp; We had an exquisitely carved front door that one latched with a gigantic antique lock that looked like it once kept the front door of a keep closed or perhaps kept a pirate’s treasure in his chest.&nbsp; We had a veranda that looked over the rice paddies, where we were served a delicious breakfast every morning (the best were the luminous green pancakes stuffed with banana and pineapple).&nbsp; Each morning, the owner would place an offering on the table and several bright red hibiscus flowers in our door.&nbsp; Our room was furnished with a king-size bed, complete with a fancy cotton mosquito net, a sturdy bamboo cupboard and a carved door, painted in bright gold and red that let to the bathroom.&nbsp; The bathroom had its own little entrance passage which opened out into a huge room with a bath, shower, toilet and basin (with mirror and carved doors above it).&nbsp; The floor was covered with smallish black stones (the kind they heat up and use for massages in the East) that provided a strange, yet pleasant foot massage.<BR><BR>Hibiscus Inn is run by a wonderful man called Made (a very popular name here in Bali).&nbsp; He teaches people in Ubud to be chefs (hence the fantastic breakfasts), plays and makes musical instruments and loves to tell his guests all about Balinese culture and things to see around Ubud.&nbsp; Talking to him confirmed our suspicions that Balinese people see themselves as quite separate from the rest of Indonesia.&nbsp; In AD 78, the Hindus of East Java ran to Bali to escape the Muslims there and they still are pretty separate.&nbsp; According to Made, Hindus are spiritual people who like to show tourists their culture, whereas the rest of Indonesia is more worldly in its judgements.<BR><BR>On one of our evenings in Ubud, we went to go and watch a dance company’s performance of the famous Barong dance in the ancient Palace grounds.&nbsp; Made was the “violin” player (an instrument played with a bow, but with 2 strings and held vertical, resting on the floor) of the group.&nbsp; The Barong is the creature who saved the kingdom by defeating the evil widow and cleansing all the villagers.&nbsp; He is a huge shaggy four-legged creature with vicious teeth and a huge crown (it takes 2 guys to move him around inside the costume) and a carved wooden lion like face.&nbsp; The Barong face is often carved into door frames throughout Bali.&nbsp; The Barong dance performance was very entertaining and definitely far superior to the dances we had seen in Thailand and Malaysia.<BR><BR>The most spectacular place that we visited in Bali was the stone carvings of Gunung Kawi, a Hindu temple.&nbsp; They are at the bottom of the world’s steepest, longest climb into a river valley.&nbsp; The carvings are copies of statues that are several metres high each, carved directly into the cliff face, but no wonder no one knows who made them (although legend had it that a goddess carved them with her fingernails in one night) because they are symbolic and more like Lego towers than actual people.&nbsp; The area also had a small homestead carved in the rocks – entrances to houses, complete with doorways and windows.&nbsp; The time and number of people that it must have taken to create these huge edifices must have been enormous.&nbsp; I was awestruck.&nbsp; There were many nooks and crannies to explore and we enjoyed being away from sarong sellers and in the cool rain for a while. &nbsp;<BR><BR>Our final bit of culture in Ubud was the Antonio Blanco museum of Erotic Art.&nbsp; Antonio Blanco was a Spanish Pilipino who moved to Bali after studying art around the world, married a famous Balinese dancer, had a rather obsessive fixation for naked women (especially soapy ones) and who died in 1999.&nbsp; He had a museum built on his estate about 10 years ago and so most of the paintings have personal commentary just below them, written by Antonio himself.&nbsp; One of the most interesting parts about the museum was that Antonio made each of the picture’s frames himself.&nbsp; His artwork ranges from oil paintings, to bad poetry, to Salvador Dali-esk sketches, to water colours – and all with their own individual frames.&nbsp; Some of the frames are massive gold things (with Antonio written on top), some are women whose draping leg you lift up to see the painting, and others are collections of bars of soap …<BR>The museum’s estate owns about 20 large parrots and cockatoos, all of whom are very tame.&nbsp; The people who work at the museum are very friendly and one of the ladies showed us the Michael Jackson painting (one of the many artists who visited Antonio whilst he was alive) and explained that the “Black or white” written at the bottom of the painting asked the observer what colour Michael Jackson’s penis was – underneath a hat at the top of the frame, is a … carrot !! (MJ is a vegetarian).<BR><BR>We decided to hire a car for a few days while in Bali – a rather educational experience.&nbsp; We hired a little Suzuki Jimny that had seen better days and which was most definitely a rattle-trap, but which had air-con that worked (and was our saving grace many a time).&nbsp; The roads in Bali are thin (often a road sign will indicate no busses or trucks because of this), seldom have any markings and often, infuriatingly, swap to one-way halfway down the road.&nbsp; Luckily, we soon discovered the national custom of hooting when coming up to a corner in the road (it is more than likely that a scooter will be coming down it the wrong way, so best to warn them) and this saved us a lot in excess on our insurance.&nbsp;&nbsp; The most annoying thing about trying to get anywhere in Bali though, was the fact the every map we were given showed different roads and none of them seemed to relate to reality.&nbsp; We eventually had to give up and navigate by “feeling” (the road signs, where they exist, are usually hidden by the encroaching jungle).&nbsp; This meant that we saw a lot of the more rural villages and countryside than most tourists do (good), but took over 4 hours to do a half-hour trip to Tanah Lot (bad - thank goodness for air-con).<BR><BR>While we had our little car, we decided to explore the Southern little bulge of Bali.&nbsp; This part of Bali is mostly little villages (where roads thin down to nothing) and expensive, 5-star hotels and spas.&nbsp; Most are in an area known as Nusa Dua, a luxury tourist enclave that was specifically designed as an exclusive (no touts allowed and all hawkers have allotted numbers) resort to minimise the impact on the environment and to maximise the impact on the island’s coffers.&nbsp; It was built specifically to right the wrongs of the cheap-seats where we stayed – Kuta.<BR><BR>On the Southern cliffs of Bali is a hotel resort called (imaginatively), Bali Cliffs Resort.&nbsp; We went there specifically to ride in the glass elevator that takes one several stories down to the ocean-side restaurant and “ancient cave”.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it was only open in the evening, so we had lunch by the pool that looked like it spilled over the cliff edge and watched the swallows diving past to take sips from it.&nbsp; We would have stayed, but the prices were a little out our league.&nbsp; One night’s accommodation in the presidential villa is USD 5000.&nbsp; Even though the receptionist was willing to offer us a discount…<BR><BR>On the beach front in Kuta, is the Hard Rock Hotel (ever heard of one of these before) and we decided to splash out one evening and have dinner at the Hard Rock Café, hoping to catch sight of some live music.&nbsp; When we looked at the menu, we saw Mexican food and instantly realised that we had been craving this taste since we left Cape Town.&nbsp; Although expensive, the nachos and guacamole was like water to someone lost in the desert.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the band had stopped playing when we had finished eating and so we just wondered around looking at all the signed guitars and records – drooling hopelessly.<BR><BR>An interesting change from Thailand, is that nearly all the tourists in Bali are Australian.&nbsp; The Balinese people even say “Hello Mate” and the food is often called something like: Australian Breakfast.&nbsp; It has taken a while to get used to the new accents.&nbsp; We are trying not to strike up a conversation about the recent Cricket World Cup…<BR><BR>Bali is much, much more expensive than we expected – at least 2 or 3 time the prices quoted in the guidebook.&nbsp; Besides Singapore, Bali has been the most expensive place that we have been to.&nbsp;&nbsp; Part of this is because there are very few really cheap places to eat (one tires of rice with vegetables and noodles with vegetables – all drenched in too much oil).&nbsp; In addition to this, the locals here are not shy to ask prices that are up to 20 times what they would expect to get.&nbsp; In Thailand, halving an asking price was reasonable, here we sometimes have to hold onto a pole to get our breathes back when we hear the initial mark-ups.&nbsp; The local newspaper costs Rp 5,000, but one guy in Ubud asked us consistently for Rp 45,000.&nbsp; Luckily, once they discover that you know how much you are supposed to pay, the asking price comes down very quickly.&nbsp; Constantly repeating “no, 5,000” until the guy gives in (about 3 times) seems to be the easiest way to sort the newspaper guys out.&nbsp; But it does seem that we are getting better at bargaining.&nbsp; We have finally realised that when someone laughs at your initial offer and asks for another price, you don’t have to go up – just stick to a reasonable amount and refuse to be ripped off.&nbsp; Usually the lack of tourists and the fact that they have already put the clothing on you will encourage them to be reasonable.<BR><BR>Another favourite tactic here, is to suggest that you “buy another one.”&nbsp; Since most people are selling the same thing: sarongs, shirts, watches etc. they try to encourage you to buy lots.&nbsp; It is rather sad for me, because my usual tactic of holding up an identical item and saying that I already have one doesn’t work here.<BR><BR>There are touts everywhere in Bali.&nbsp; Everyone is trying to sell you something.&nbsp; Waiters approach you while you are eating and offer CDs or boat trips, taxi drivers insist that you try their friend’s place first before they drop you where you want to go, basically anyone local who talks to you ends up offering something.&nbsp; It is sad because we have become closed and unfriendly, thus not meeting many people – but touts will create a monster out of even the most gregarious people.<BR><BR>Bali is a volcanic island and as a result, the beaches have been extremely disappointing.&nbsp; I was under the impression that since it is sold as an island paradise, the beaches would be fantastic, but no.&nbsp; Most of the beaches are completely black with very fine volcanic ash (very interesting, but off-putting) and the others are greyish and look like they have oil spilled on them.<BR><BR>One of the blackest beaches we went to was Tanah Lot.&nbsp; Tanah Lot is a miniature island 50m off the West coast of Bali that you can walk across to during low tide.&nbsp; It is home to one of the most important Hindu temples on Bali and as a result, is swarming with people constantly.&nbsp; You can’t go into the temple because it is too holy but you can walk along the beach and watch the sunset over the island.&nbsp; We rather enjoyed the rock formations and sunset here, but the little children selling postcards were more than enough to bear.&nbsp; To them, no just means try a lower price and on further, insistent nos, just come back in another 5 minutes.<BR>We spent the night in the little village (so we could see the sunset and not get too lost going home) at a hotel with a beautiful pool and a bathroom full of eager, scary ants.<BR><BR>Gunung Batur is one of the active volcanoes in Northeast Bali.&nbsp; We spent a lovely day driving up to it and around the lake below it.&nbsp; The little car was amazing and made it up some seriously steep and treacherous hills (even if it needed a run up and several tries for the worst ones).&nbsp; This area is very fertile from the volcanic ash and the banks of the lake grow all sorts of things from onions to soya beans to tomatoes.&nbsp; There are boxes floating just offshore in the lake, which we decided must be storing fish to keep them fresh.&nbsp; We also saw guys rowing in the lake in little dugouts, looking like they were on the verge of sinking.<BR>
<P></P>
<P>Whilst in Ubud, we saw a tour to the Komodo islands, to see the famous Komodo dragons.&nbsp; After much deliberation, we decided to try to get there ourselves and save on our costs.&nbsp; But that tale will have to wait for the next exciting instalment. </P></span><!-- End_Module_422 -->
