						<b>Relations</b>
						<br />
By David

</p>
				<p>The plan for our last month in South Africa is to circumnavigate
the country in an anti-clockwise direction, visiting and meeting the
people who make up our families.
</p>
				<p>Bidding the Webbs and Crawford Brunts of Plett fairwell, we
headed up the N2 highway, though Port Elizabeth and onto camp in Port
Alfred. Wendy had the number of her mother's cousin Veronica, who she
had last seen when she was four, some 21 years before. The number we
had didn't work, but, after noticing that all the other Port Alfred
numbers seemed to be one digit shorter than the number we had, Wendy
lucked onto the right number, and a rather surprised and delighted
relation, who we made arrangements to visit the following day. Two more
phone calls also secured us dinner with my cousin Jason and his fiancé
Mandy, and accommodation at our first backpacking establishment,
Gonubie Backpackers for the following night.
</p>
				<p>Shortly after we had finished supper and readying ourselves for
bed, the fellow occupying the tent next to ours arrived - in is 1950's
Porché! The following morning we awoke to find him all packed up,
sitting in the Porche with the top down and his dog in the passenger
seat, eating his breadfast. That done, he donned his driving / golfing
hat and roared off - obviously off to the next exotic destination on
his post midlife crisis roadtrip.
</p>
				<p>On our way out of town towards East London we turned off the
main road to get some pictures of the area, and were surprised by the
lack of tarred roads. We were also surprised by the freezing water, and
Wendy's suntan lotion, which valiantly popped its top and liberally
smeared itself over Wendy and most of the passenger's car door. Which
must be why it is called total blockout.
</p>
				<p>We made it into East London by late morning, and began looking
for a place we could connect to the 'net and download our email. After
wondering around the downtown area for a while, and stumbling into some
establishments that are clearly meant for sailors who have been trapped
at sea for too long we finally managed to find an Internet Café. Which
was closed. But, it did have a number on it, which we phoned, and were
informed that there was no way we would be allowed to connect our
laptop to their Internet connection. We got the same story at the
second Internet Café we found. Next we tried the hotels, most of whom I
had to introduce to the concept of a business centre, until we were
finally referred to the local PostNet branch by a helpful receptionist
at the Holiday Inn hotel.
</p>
				<p>Our quest to 'net access finally ended at the Post Net branch,
after a short, er, site seeing tour of East London. PostNet was more
than happy to rent us their phone, and since they are a nationwide
chain, we have used them all over. Internet Café's in South Africa seem
to be decidedly un-laptop friendly. Which is sad, since there must be a
market (of at least one - me) that would be more than happy to spend my
mornings working in said Café, and consuming tea and cake.
</p>
				<p>Our next stop was later that afternoon in Gonubie, just a
little way outside of East London, to visit Veronica, and reconnect
with an entire arm of Wendy's family who we had lost contact with.
Wendy had last seen Veronica and her mom, Freda when she was 4, some 21
years ago, so it was with some trepidation that we rang the doorbell.
However, we had a most enjoyable afternoon tea, pouring through old
photographs and trying to place people in the family tree.
</p>
				<p>After tea we headed down to the Gonubie backpackers where we
planned to spent the night - our first in a backpackers. It turned out
to be a rambling old house on the beachfront, with a somewhat
decoratatively challenged but otherwise quite functional room. We were
greeted at the gate by the little girl of the house, a spritely young
lass who promptly squirted us with her water filled octopus, and then
introduced us to her mum. We battled to keep a straight face as she
explained the rules of the house to us, since she had probably the
worst teeth we had ever seen, almost completely rotted away.
</p>
				<p>That evening we had a vegetable braai with cousin Jason Crerar
(my mom's sister Mandy's eldest son) and his fiancé Mandy (Down Edopis,
down!), and then spent an uneventful night in the backpackers (except
for the cold shower; perhaps good preparation for Indonesia).
</p>
				<p>The next day, Saturday 5th January saw us continuing up the
east coast of South Africa, amazed at how the vegetation became more
and more tropical, the climate more humid, and the distance attached to
the "warning: cows" signs becoming greater, from 10km to a total of
150km (obviously a hoax, since didn't encounter any cows). We also
listened to an interesting radio program where a chicken sexer was
being interviewed - apparently he sexes day old chickens by turning
their genetalia inside out, and can do up to 900 / hour!
</p>
				<p>We spent the next two days with Uncle John, his wife Marichen
and their two children Vian and Nicole, in Uvongo on the Durban South
coast. The humidity of Durban came as something of a shock, but other
than that we had a super time, swimming in the ultra warm sea, touring
the beachfront and learning all about the latest action figures and
computer games from Vian, whose large black eyes and excited babble
entertained us for hours. </p>
				<p>We left Uncle John and Marichen, to head down to Southbroom.
On our way we stopped in Margate, at a mobile recording studio we had
spied at the beachfront. I was keen to try out my new guitar with
pickup, and record two songs. What a great if nerve racking experience.
I battled to get through an entire rendition of a song without my
fingers getting in a knot; especially when every pick and waver in my
voice was amplified back a thousand times over the headphones!
Fortunately I get several ties at each song, and eventually managed to
get half decent covers of The Beatles "Yesterday" and Crowded House's
"Better be Home Soon" recorded on CD (my first - merchandising and
movie rights to be sold to the first bidder).
</p>
				<p>We arrived in Southbroom later that morning. Southbroom is an
interesting place, seeming to be less developed than the rest of the
South coast, yet at the same time it seems more money has been invested
in ensuring that it appears less developed. Tim has a three bedroom
flat in an amazing holiday complex, whose front lawn appears to drop
right into the sea. His mom has done a lovely job decorating the flat,
with the entire passage covered in montages of family photos.
</p>
				<p>Scrabble, sleeping late, walks on the beach and an excellent
prego roll later, we left the beach house, stopped in at the famous
Waffle house for chocolate mousse, lemon meringue and banana and
caramel waffles, and then made our way up the hill to Tim's parents
house in Winston Park, Hillcrest, to meet Jem Norton and D@vid Seaward
for the last episode in their epic roll-playing quest.
</p>
				<p>We spent the next few days with Tim, enjoying the luxury
accommodation (we were in Tim's parents massive bedroom, as they were
travelling in the Cape at the time). One afternoon, during a trip to
the Pavillion shopping mall, we bought the first third of our foreign
exchange as US dollar based traveller's cheques. Flight centre (where
we got our plane tickets) had given us a voucher for VIP exchange rates
at American Express, so we were quite excited to see the special deal
we would be receiving. The ended up offering us a pathetic 1c / dollar
"discount", that coupled with their poor rate and high fees made them
the worst of the three bureau in the banking isle. Eventually we ended
up buying our Thomas Cook traveller's cheques from Standard Bank, who
were selling them at nearly 8c cheaper than the Thomas Cook bureau next
door.
</p>
				<p>We left Tim on the Wednesday - he was heading down to Cape Town
to stay in our flat, and we made our way to stay with my cousin Mandy
(my mom's elder sister) in her house in Kloof. Several years ago Mandy
got involved / started a cat rescue unit, which rescues cats and tries
to place them in good homes. The cats which cannot be placed for one
reason or another end up staying with Mandy, and over the years this
has grown to quite a family, currently standing at 42. </p>
				<p>Feeding time was quite an experience - 40 something eyes
boring into your back whilst you prepare the cat food is quite an
experience. However, the cats are well behaved, and once each had its
own bowl, the cat room was filled the sounds of munching kitties.
</p>
				<p>Listening to Mandy speak about the cats gives you an insight as
to how much she loves them - each has it own carefully chosen name and
story. There is a dwarf cat, Thombalena, a cat with one eye, a cat who
is old and eats on top of the fridge so the others don't bully it, a
cat allergic to fish, and one who always sits in the same tree,
regardless of how hard it is raining.
</p>
				<p>On Saterday the 18th, we left Mandy, collected Gran Rae Laing
at her flat in Berea and drove up away from the humidity to the
Bushman's Nek resource in the southern Drakensberg, just outside
Underberg, and right on the Lethsoto border. Gran Rae had arranged for
a bungalow there, for her timeshare.
</p>
				<p>We spent a lovely week there with Gran Rae, learning about the
Laing side of the family, discovering her slight obsession with ginger
as a spice, and the necessity of always using serving spoons. We also
bowled, swam and went on a hike that took us over the border and into
Lesotho. </p>
				<p>The week over, we drove back to Durban, popped in to visit my
aunt Lola Kirby (nee Laing) - were discovered that Steffi had managed
to get more burned than we had on our hike; the only place that wasn't
bright red was her face, making her look somewhat like an orangutang -
dropped off Gran Rae and headed up the north coast to the False Bay
nature reserve outside Hluhle, and right on the St Lucia estuary.
</p>
				<p>Unlike the False Bay of the Western Cape peninsula, this was
actually a proper false bay - a kidney shaped 'lake' within the St.
Lucia estuary. The bay was dominated by the yellow fever trees,
screaming cicada beetles raising the temperature and multitudes
disappointing of "Do not swim: crocodile" signs. It was however,
remarkably beautiful, and reminded me of the Kruger park in many ways.
</p>
				<p>Since we were already so far north we decided to drive through
Swaziland on our way to Nelspruit - and get our first bit of customs
experience. Exciting South Africa was going well, until the customs
inspection officer found my guitar, and began suspiciously asking
whether this was my guitar, how old it was, and if I was smuggling it
into Swaziland for resale. Eventually he called his partner over, who,
since it was during the heat of the day decided that it was too much
bother to pursue the matter any further and waved us through the
border.
</p>
				<p>During our drive through Swaziland via Big Bend to Mbabane, we
came across a string of signs warning of "road failure" in 10km (which
we were unable to find), people collecting relief maize in
wheelbarrows, many shops titled "XYZ Grocery", and an amazing amount
"Jesus lives" graffiti on the rocks along the road.
</p>
				<p>We stayed in an area called Happy Valley - the casino and
resort strip between Manzini and Mbabane - in a hotel called Happy
Valley Motel. We discovered that our hotel had the only disco in the
country - and the only infamous Go Go bar, which was featuring the
exotic Tylor from South Africa. </p>
				<p>Being somewhat less than enticed by our hotels offering, we
headed off to the Royal Swazi Casino down the road, the hangout of the
rich and famous of Swaziland. Unperturbed by all the fancy cars in the
parking lot, we parked our old Opel (which by now was sporting the
dust, mud and other muck of some 5000 km of travel) next to the BMW
X5s, the Jeeps and the 'langslapper' Mercs. With the exception of one
rather sprightly cockroach, we enjoyed a nice buffet meal, a guitarist
playing an electric nylon stringed guitar, and even managed to make the
entrance charge back on the slot machines (which, given we were playing
the 10c machine, was a big win!)
</p>
				<p>The next day we visited the Ngwena glass factory, followed the
signs to South Africa (ie, right to Piggs Peak, left to South Africa)
and exited at the Oshoek border with little more than a long queue wait
and another argument with customs officials over my guitar. It was then
a short trip to Nelspruit, via a long hill which warned you of the STOP
sign in 10km (obviously a big deal in those parts : )
</p>
				<p>We arrived in Nelspruit to spend the next week with Wend's
parents in their house in the bushes. But I'll leave that to Wendy to
describe.
</p>
				<p>
						<b>Relations II</b>
						<br />
By Wendy


</p>
				<p>The most part of the week in Nelspruit provided us with ample
preparation for the hot and sticky weather we are expecting in South
East Asia - so we spent a lot of time just sitting and melting. But, we
had some lovely rain on the last 2 days - something I really miss in
Cape Town is the wonderful Lowveld showers over summer.
</p>
				<p>As we arrived, we were greeted by a gorgeous little 6 week old
bullmastiff puppy and Holly and Angus. The next-door neighbour's dog
had puppies and it sounds like my parents couldn't say no to the
imploring looks of her owner, so now they have a new baby. He is called
Bully (after his parentage) and is really cute. He had to get dipped
once and afterwards, he followed us around the house, shivering sadly
in eye-catching spots. No one believed that in 35 degree heat, he could
be cold, so he eventually had to go to sleep on a rock. </p>
				<p>While we were there, Bully saw his first rain ever. Although
this is supposed to be the rainy season, it has been extremely dry in
Nelspruit this year. The river is lower than I have seen it before,
even during winter. It is definitely concerning for the farmers and
everyone in the area. My parents are being extremely conservative with
watering their small patch of grass in case they can't survive to next
summer on their borehole.
</p>
				<p>My parent's house is very near to completion now. The only
major thing left in my eyes, is the banister for the stairs - I hate
walking up and down them with nothing to save me if I trip (something
that I seem to have developed quite an advanced level of skill in). The
upstairs bathroom was taken apart no less than 3 times, for various
reasons, but it is now amazing. I have never seen a Mexican theme in a
bathroom, but the cacti add a lovely touch to the side of the amazing
oval jet bath. This bath room should go on show in the Garden and Home.
Their upstairs deck provides a spectacular view of the bushveld and
mountains around them. I can see why they often us this as their Sunday
morning retreat. During the mornings while my Mom was at work, David
and I helped a little with a few small jobs like sealing the laundry
cupboards.
</p>
				<p>For my Mom's birthday, we went out to the restaurant at the
casino for dinner and live music. The food was rather mediocre, but we
did get to try a crocodile salad and my parents had a ball sharing a
black cherry desert. The live musician was quite fun, but we had to
move closer to hear him over the casino noise - very annoying. He
played 2 songs from Areo Speadwagon - who knew that they had written
more than one? I think my Mom enjoyed herself, which is the main thing.
</p>
				<p>My Mom only works 4 mornings a week, so on Friday we all drove
off to have pancakes in Graskop and see God's Window. It was a bit of a
gamble, given then Nelspruit was cloudy, but we went off anyway. This
made it the 3rd time that David has been to God's Window and the 3rd
time that he hasn't been able to see his hand stretched out in front of
him. He is going to stop believing us that there is a view out there.
But, the pancakes were delicious as usual. I had a preserved fig and
pecan nut one - very interesting combination, but I think I will go
back to my old favourite (banana and caramel) next time. We discovered
that this little pancake shop is actually a franchise and part of the
Harrie's chain that has just opened a shop up at the V&amp;A in Cape
Town. Quite a difference in size and atmosphere between the 2.
</p>
				<p>My parents also took us to see an ancient Indian (Hindu?)
shrine that was recently discovered in Nelspruit. It is in the little
nature reserve right in the middle of town. The shrine turned out to be
a rock lying above 2 others - naturally placed like that. I did not
know that this particular formation had been worshipped as holy before.
It is a pity that we couldn't listen to the guy who had found it
speaking on it, because it sounds like a very interesting history. </p>
				<p>Just as we were all sitting near the shrine, drinking well
earned Cokes (3kms is far to walk in the humidity, especially when
clouds are building), the heavens opened and we started to get soaked
by huge drops of water. We started running. We decided to take my
father's suggestion that it would be quicker to go down the river to
the car, than to take the path. Silly. It wasn't long and we were all
soaking wet, muddy, burning from stinging nettles and stuck on the top
of a huge boulder, unable to go backwards or forwards. But, we all
eventually managed to get back in one piece, just in time for the sun
to come back out.
</p>
				<p>One evening, we took a drive to see the now operational Kruger
Mpumalanga International Airport. I thought that it was a very good
representation of the Lowveld - with thatched roof and wooden pillars.
It is still rather small, but is apparently able to handle Boeings and
is hoping to have traffic from as far as Heathrow in the near future.
We watched as several smaller planes took off and landed - the place
gets rather busy at around 5pm. Now all they need to do, is tar the
road to get to the airport - so visitors can get to and from the
airport!
</p>
				<p>Next stop, to see Brian (my brother) in Centurion. We were
hoping to have Sunday lunch with the Krugers, but they had gone to
Durban for the week, so we went to Centurion Lake and had sandwiches at
the Mugg and Bean there. The afternoon and evening with Brian was good.
I miss him a lot and don't often get the chance to see him - and now we
are going to be away and not see him for at least 3, and maybe even 11
months. We went to go and watch "Amazing Caves" at the IMAX - a pretty
amazing one. I much preferred it to the Extreme Sports one which I
watched a few years ago. This one had a story line and lots of
different impressive shots. This climbing down into ice caves part was
the scariest for me. It is really beautiful, all lit up with blue
light, but the water is continuously melting and refreezing and can
come down on you at any time.
</p>
				<p>In the evening, we tried to play Diablo, but we all had
incompatible versions and all we succeeded in doing was to break our
copy. We all eventually went to bed in disgust.
</p>
				<p>The next day, we went to Makro to attempt to spend our vouchers
there. It turned out to be rather difficult. We don't want anything
heavy or that will take up space and the only stuff we still need can't
be found anywhere except Cape Union Mart (although so far, none of the
branches we have tried have had it). We eventually settled on a poncho
for David and a bottle of wine as a wedding present for Doug and Ellen.
</p>
				<p>We then popped into the centre of Jo'burg to have coffee with a
friend of David's from the Standard Bank bursary scheme - Vaughn. I
found him extremely interesting. He is currently trading in currency
futures - something which I am keen on trying when we get to London -
and so I tried to get some helpful opinions and experience tips from
him. </p>
				<p>We then drove off to our final destination for the day -
Sasolberg. We were amazed to be stopped in a road works block for
nearly 20 minutes - when Sasolberg was already in sight.
</p>
				<p>We met Paul Jacobson (friend from UCT) at the Shell garage
there and we drove off to see his new flat. Paul lives on his own in a
3-bedroomed flat - the only way he can have enough space for all his
war gaming miniatures and computer and himself. He was just as pleased
to see us as we were to see him - no one ever comes to see him here,
because he is the only attraction in the whole town.
</p>
				<p>The next morning, we left on a very hot and long drive back to
Plett. We split the drive up by stopping off in Nieubethesda, somewhere
that I have never been before (and believe me, once is enough!).
Nieubethesda is a little Karoo town about 50kms northwest of Graaff
Reinette. There is nothing here except sand and a few houses. This
little town's claim to fame is the Owl House, which has put it on the
map and is now encouraging other artists to move here. The Owl House is
a little house at the edge of the town that used to be the home of a
Miss Helen. She was an eccentric lady and extremely unhappy. After the
death of here parents (1960's ?), she was left all alone in the world.
She decided to bring colour into her life, so she replaced some house
windows with coloured glass, painted big suns and owns on other
windows, and put crushed glass all over all the walls and roofs of the
house. The effect is dramatic, especially with all the mirrors that she
added to the rooms. Miss Helen went on to fill here garden with statues
made of wire and concrete and glass. She made a nativity scene, serving
ladies with huge glass skirts, little houses of bottles, poetry written
in wire on the fences, hundreds and hundreds of owls, pictures of
people made from glass, little churches etc. etc. The town shunned her
though, because she combined Christian religion with Muslim and other
religion and because she was so different to them. Eventually, Miss
Helen was alone and going blind, so she killed herself in 1976 by
drinking caustic soda (an extremely painful death). It is an extremely
sad story and the house and garden are haunted by memories of her
emotional turmoil. Now, of course, the townsfolk are only too happy to
accept her and to benefit from the fame she brings their town.
</p>
				<p>The next morning, we drove off to Plett and cooler weather.
This was one of the hottest days of our SA trip (it was 38 degrees C in
Graaff Reinette). We stopped off in Somerset East (the town where my
Xhosa teacher grew up) for lunch and the salad (the most filling thing
we could eat) was all wilted by the time it got to us. I drove from
here all the way to Storms River. We didn't stop along the way, we just
wanted to get to Plett and to cool down. While I was driving, it
occurred to me that this was the last time in perhaps 4 years that I
would be driving a car.
</p>
				<p>The stop in Plett was very traumatic, especially for David. The
reality of selling his car made everything seem to final. His family
were all being very brave, but we all felt sad and frightened of the
future.
</p>
				<p>Our final destination - Cape Town. We arrived on Friday morning
and spent the next 3 days, packing in final goodbyes and last minute
administrative things. We got our International Driver's licences, saw
how Cathy and Tim were doing in their new home (and sadly discovered
that the basil and Roo had died), had breakfast with Leonie and Gordon
(who talked non-stop about his trip to Thailand - very useful for us,
but boring for Leonie), went to Canal Walk with Nazeem and Deidre (who
generously bought us the last few things we needed) and stayed in a
backpackers in Long Street. </p>
