<I>Frightening away the evil spirits.</I> <BR>By Wendy<BR><BR>Nyepi is Balinese New Year.&nbsp; It is a festival that takes place at the end of the rainy season, either the end March or the beginning April.&nbsp; This year, it took place on the 1st and 2nd of April and we were there to celebrate the beginning of 1925. (Of the Bali Hindu calendar)<BR><BR>Each small village in Bali creates a giant ogah-ogah in the weeks prior to Nyepi.&nbsp; This ogah-ogah usually has a bamboo frame and paper maché outer body.&nbsp; This guy is supposed to big and scary and more often than not a character out of one of the Hindu stories (although we did see a Superman ogah-ogah), with huge teeth and battling a snake or monkeys.&nbsp; When he is finished, it takes about 20 strong young en to carry the ogah-ogah around.&nbsp; <BR><BR>On the night before Nyepi, the ogah-ogahs are paraded around the town – taken to the temples and market places for everyone to see.&nbsp; Then they are all burnt to symbolise the victory of good over evil and the expelling of evil from the island and everyone has a huge party with lots of Arak (palm oil wine).&nbsp; Apparently drinking Arak is a little like being hit over the head with an elephant.&nbsp; The next day, no lights or fires are allowed for 24 hours and no one is allowed out on the streets – Bali is pretending to be deserted so that the evil spirits think it is boring and don’t come back.<BR><BR>Whilst in Bali the first time, we had seen the young men of the villages working very hard on creating their ogah-ogahs and it didn’t take long for us to pick up on the heightening excitement in the air.&nbsp; We watched the ogah-ogahs grow long fingernails and be adorned with huge, bulging muscles.&nbsp; Eventually, we decided that if we could make it back to Bali from BaliNyepi in time, we would stay for the festival.&nbsp; And luckily, we did.<BR><BR>After booking back into our Kuta hotel with air-con and swimming pool (I’m not pretending to not exist somewhere all day without essential creature comforts), we kept our ears open for an idea of where the big event may take place.&nbsp; During the lead up to Nyepi, there were many dedication ceremonies on the beach – all attended by hundreds of suitably attired Balinese (black and white sarongs and white headbands – representing good and evil).&nbsp; The importance of Nyepi even meant that Kuta’s shops were closed before sunset and some didn’t open at all that week.&nbsp;&nbsp; We really enjoyed the quiet and lack of touts.<BR><BR>Just after sunset on the 1st April, we strolled up to the main road in Kuta to see what we could see.&nbsp; After walking past rows of closed shops, we eventually encountered the rear of the procession of ogah-ogahs.&nbsp; They were all laid out on the ground for judging.&nbsp; The newspapers said that they weren’t that grand this year due to lack of financing (huge drop in tourism after the bombings), but they were still spectacular.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were about 15 in total – some grim reapers, many Barongs battling dragons, a few evil widows and lots of blue guys.&nbsp; They were all about 4 or 5 meters tall and sported long teeth and fingernails.&nbsp; Several of them had flashing third eyes and one Barong’s dragon had lights flashing up and down his tongue.&nbsp; Each one had an attached army of men to carry it and some had dancing girls and musicians.&nbsp; <BR><BR>After a quick, amazingly delicious, pizza at the only restaurant serving food on the road, we went back just in time to watch the parade begin.&nbsp; Each ogah-ogah had an opportunity to be lifted up and ushered down the road to cheering from the crowd and lots of drumming.&nbsp; We followed them down the road to discover an open area surrounded by a sea of people.&nbsp; Here we watched excitedly as the ogah-ogah rushed up and down the area fighting his dragon to the loud, expressive commentary of a story teller and the accompanying shrieks, howls, hoots and drumming.&nbsp; The atmosphere was electric as the ogah-ogah slew his dragon and triumphantly paraded down the road with his entourage.<BR><BR>About 1km down the road, the scene was enacted again before the ogah-ogah was finally retired on the beach (but only after a guy with an extremely long pole had to help him under the electricity wiring).&nbsp; The carriers were particularly glad to rest their arms, have another cigarette and talk to their friends.&nbsp; <BR><BR>We sat on the beach for a while, but eventually had to walk back home.&nbsp; Our eyes were closing and it would be several hours before the burning ceremony.&nbsp; This turned out to be an inspired move because not much later, the heavens opened and positively drenched the whole of Bali.&nbsp; The police were glad because they didn’t have to break up any arak-induced fights between rival ogah-ogah carriers that night.<BR><BR>The next day, we hid out in the hotel for day, pretending we weren’t home. The hotel’s entrance was barricaded with plastic and all the shops had newspapers over their windows.&nbsp; As requested, we didn’t switch on any lights; eventually having to navigate around our room with a [dimmed] torch. Unfortunately, our day of lounging around the pool eating simple meals turned out to be cloudy and overcast.&nbsp; However, the streets were definitely deserted and hopefully we managed to fool the evil spirits for one more year.<BR><BR>We certainly hope that the evil spirits are gone because tourism is really down since the October 12th bombing last year.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only movie house in Kuta has closed down and there is a proliferation of anti terrorism shirts for sale – saying things like: “Osama don’t surf, “F**k terrorists” etc.&nbsp; Restaurants are deserted and shops outnumber tourists by about 5 to 1.&nbsp; This unfortunately means that the shop owners are only too keen on selling you something, anything, and will almost drag you away to have your hair plaited or nails done or to buy a new shirt.&nbsp; <BR><BR>One morning, David ran back to our hotel to get something and I waited, trying to be invisible, for him on the roadside.&nbsp; It didn’t take long and my Ferrari shirt entered me into a discussion about buying a Ferrari perfume or shirt or watch.&nbsp; By the time David came to rescue me, I had several watches on my arm and 3 guys pointing out other exciting things in the shop.&nbsp; I have actually been looking for a new watch for some time now (mine was on its 3rd battery in a month and was still losing time, so it got retired) and this was surprisingly, the first shop where I saw something that I liked.&nbsp; So we bought one (but only after halving the guy’s initial offer, attempting to take the watch off my arm several times and walking away because my thrifty husband said no – all very good bargaining techniques!).&nbsp; To our dismay, a few hours later the watch had stopped.&nbsp; Some shark tried to sell us a new [incorrect] battery for 10USD!&nbsp; We were getting a tad despondent, but to the vendor’s credit, when we complained the next day, he was only too willing to replace the watch or the battery.&nbsp; The new battery did the trick, and the watch has been working perfectly ever since.<BR><BR>We frequently walked past the site of the Bali bombings last year.&nbsp; It is right in the heart of Kuta and a very tragic sight.&nbsp; Several buildings are just rubble and there are wreaths along the road with inscriptions such as “Go with God.”<BR><BR>Just down the road from the site, we discovered a Tin-Tin memorabilia shop.&nbsp; David was ecstatic!&nbsp; We sifted through hundreds of French Tin-Tin shirts until we found an English Tin-Tin goes to the moon shirt - which David is now the proud owner of, of course.&nbsp; I had to travel halfway around the world before I discovered what a Tin-Tin fan my husband is (HUGE hint for future presents).<BR><BR>Whilst in Bali we ran out of Salmon Oil pills, causing me to squeak and crack more than normal.&nbsp; We scoured the hundreds of mini-markets, department stores and ‘apoteks’ (chemists) in Kuta, but to no avail.&nbsp; The few chemists who we spoke to thought we were loopy to want to drink fish oil and even fewer were able to offer us vitamins.&nbsp; We were shocked at the lack of over the counter medicine in such a populated place.&nbsp; But maybe it is because tourists bring their own drugs with them and the locals all drink the energy drinks available everywhere?!<BR><BR>An interesting phenomenon that we have been noticing throughout our South East Asia travels, is the variation in bottle sizes.&nbsp; In South Africa, a bottle of Coke is 500ml.&nbsp; Here, it varies from 295ml to 325ml, with weird and wonderful sizes inbetween (296ml?!).&nbsp; In Thailand, you can buy 910ml of water.&nbsp; If a Coke looks particularly cheep in a restaurant, sometimes it turns out that it is because the bottle is smaller.&nbsp; Beer of course, comes in the good old 1 litre bottle.<BR><BR>The day after Nyepi, we had booked the bus to Yogyokata in Central Java.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the Denpasar bus station, they changed our bus and seat numbers and we sat around sheltering ourselves from the pouring rain watching “Everybody Loves Mary” on TV, wondering if this new bus was going to come or if we were going to have to sleep there.&nbsp; Eventually, an hour later than our tickets had originally stated, a bus drove up.&nbsp; A student who was taking the bus saw my harassed face and suggested I complain.&nbsp; So I set off bravely to complain to the bus driver who only spoke Indonesian, in English. Luckily, my upset face and confused babble resulted in us getting 2 seats on the bus and we were off to Java.<BR></P>
<P>Hopefully, the anti-war rallies across Indonesia are as peaceful as newspapers say they are.&nbsp; So far we haven’t encountered any anti-Westerner.&nbsp; But, we are keeping watchful eye on the newspaper for this and for further developments of SARS.&nbsp; We’ll just have to adjust our plans as things develop.</P></span><!-- End_Module_432 -->
