<I>Boating to see the famous dragons</I> <BR>By David<BR><BR>We decided to go to Komodo quite at the last minute, rushing to back to Kuta on the day the car was due back, and then straight to the airport where we bought plane tickets to Bima with only minutes to spare.&nbsp;&nbsp; In all the rush we left with less money that we should have, which was to prove more of a problem than anticipated the next day.<BR><BR>Indonesia is a nation of islands, numbering some 13,000.&nbsp; The further east you go, the more numerous the islands, and the Komodo National Park lies on 2 of these islands which lie between two larger landmasses, Sumbawa on the west and Flores on the east.&nbsp; A ferry runs between Sape on Sumbawa, and Lubaun Bajo on Flores, and according to our guidebook is supposed to stop at Komodo on route.<BR><BR>With this in mind, we flew direct to Bima on Sumbawa, and then caught a taxi from Bima straight to Sape.&nbsp; The guidebook describes Sape as a quaint little town; in truth it is more than a little run down, and has almost no tourist facilities (we couldn’t change money, and almost nobody speaks English).&nbsp; Our money was running low, and we were a little concerned at getting stranded having to pay in US dollars.&nbsp; (In a town with two telephones, the Mastercard adage probably isn’t true).<BR><BR>Sape’s only redeeming feature is the horse drawn chariots, ala Ben Hur style, that ferry you from the pier to the town and back.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Painted bright colours, these lighten up the dusty streets, especially when two drivers decide to race back to the pickup point.<BR><BR>People seemed almost surprised to see Westerners, and we were continually greeted with shrieks of “Hello Mister”.&nbsp; At one point we were surrounded by a group of young boys, who informed Wendy that one of their crowd was “hunky”.&nbsp; Other than pointing this out, they seemed quite happy to stand around us listening to our obviously “outlandish” accents and repeating a word one of us said every so often.<BR><BR>The ferry office at Sape informed us that the ferry no longer stopped at Komodo, and that we would perhaps be better served catching the ferry to Labaun Bajo on Flores and trying to charter a boat there.&nbsp; The owner of the surviving losman (hotel) where we were staying tried repeatedly to convince us to charter a boat from him; but his price (Rp 1,200,000) and his rather shady demeanour steered us away.&nbsp; That and the fact that we couldn’t have paid him anyway.&nbsp; In his defence, he did introduce us to the other Westerner in town, a friendly Dutch traveller named Rob.<BR><BR>Rob entertained us with tales of travelling from Komodo overland, and of the arduous 19 hour bus journey he had taken across Sumbawa, complete with the bus breaking down, everyone singing along to the same two songs played over and over, and eventually being dumped in Bima and being forced to catch a motorbike taxi to Sape.&nbsp; (Even though his ticket was to Sape).&nbsp; We were glad we had spent the extra cash and come by plane.<BR><BR>As instructed by the ferry office, I returned at 7am the following morning to buy tickets for that day’s 8am ferry.&nbsp; By this stage, acres of people, trucks and produce had arrived at the pier, all clamouring to get on the ferry.&nbsp; In true third world style the ferry office only opened around 9am.&nbsp; It took me a further half hour of scrumming (literally) to get to the ticket window where I shoved my hand roughly through the ticket window, waving my cash and indicating I wanted three tickets. This is, of course, perfectly normal behaviour when queuing for tickets in Sape.<BR><BR>We eventually made it onto the ferry around 10:30, and the ferry only left at 11.&nbsp; Given that we were told it was a 10 hour journey, we were concerned of arriving in Labaun Bajo well after dusk; not a pleasant thought given that it could be like Sape.&nbsp; Fortunately it was a beautiful day and the sea was a flat as a pancake.&nbsp; Watching snippets of satellite TV(first time we’d seen CNN &amp; BBC in Indonesia, and on a public ferry!) we made record time, and arrived in Labaun Bajo around 5pm.&nbsp; The trip was only marred by excessive smoking, and the fact that people were continually throwing their rubbish overboard!<BR><BR>Perhaps the guidebook author was thinking about Labaun Bajo when they wrote about Sape; since Labaun Bajo is a much nicer and more tourist friendly town.&nbsp; Along with Rob, we were discovered by a tout on the boat, and whisked off to one of the better hotels.&nbsp; Roberto (the tout), was one of those people who seemed to have a family member in all the major industries, and before the evening meal we had organised to charter a boat for a two day tour to see the Komodo dragons, with a night on the boat and some snorkelling thrown in.&nbsp; We were even able to get a free night’s accommodation and trips to the airport included in the deal.&nbsp; And all for half what we were quoted in Sape; proof that either our bargaining skills are improving; or that Labaun Bajo is the place to organise trips to Komodo.<BR><BR>The next morning we were ferried around town changing money and buying airplane tickets back to Komodo.&nbsp; Then we were off to the dock, and onto the boat we had chartered; which turned out to be quite a large fishing boat (40m), complete with two decks, two engines, a crew of 2 and a cook.&nbsp; Waving goodbye to Roberto and Maxi (the hotel owner, who had gotten in on the deal) we putt-putted out the harbour on route to Rinca island.<BR><BR>Between Komodo and Lombok (the next island east), there is an imaginary divide known as the Wallace line.&nbsp; To the west of the line, the flora and fauna are typical south-east Asian jungle.&nbsp; To the west it is much drier, and the flora and fauna becomes more like that found in Australia.&nbsp; Besides different flora and fauna, the cultures tend to change from island to island.&nbsp; Whereas Komodo is Hindu, and Sumbawa is Muslim, Flores is more Christian.&nbsp; The further east we went, the less developed it became.&nbsp; Good, because people were more friendly and things cheaper, bad because there are fewer tourist services.<BR><BR>The Komodo National Park spans the two main islands where the Komodo dragons are found, Rinca and Komodo.&nbsp; Rinca also hosts other animals such as water buffalo and wild horses, which we hoped to see when we set of with out park guide on a 2 hour walk. <BR>Being to the east of the Wallace line, Rinca has a much drier climate.&nbsp; The flora is remarkably like African grassland, with wide open grass plains dotted with short stumpy trees and prickly pear bushes.&nbsp; The only things that ruin the illusion are the palm trees, which soar up above the grass.&nbsp; That, and the fact that the principle predator on the island is the Komodo dragon.<BR><BR>We weren’t disappointed on our walk, and discovered a Komodo dragon resting under a tree about half way through.&nbsp; They look exactly like overgrown lizards, growing to between 2 – 3 meters in length, and weighing around 50kg.&nbsp; Solitary animals, they hunt alone, hiding in the long grass and surprising their prey.&nbsp; Impressively, they can bring down a water buffalo, and eat almost their own body weight in one sitting.&nbsp; Believed to be descended from an extinct species of lizard from Australia, the dragons are only found on the two islands of Komodo National Park and the western shores of Flores.&nbsp; There were two American scientists from the San Diego zoo on the island whilst we were there, performing the annual census.&nbsp; There are around 2500 dragons in total, ¾ of which are male.<BR><BR>On the way back to the boat we saw several more Komodo dragons at the park offices, and then two more right at the pier.&nbsp; If you want to be assured of seeing the dragons, Rinca is the place to go (the exact opposite of what the guidebook says).<BR><BR>Roberto had assured us that the boat we were chartering had two engines.&nbsp; This was important he said, since you didn’t want to be stranded out to see should one of them fail.&nbsp; And he was right, because as we putt-putted our way away from Rinca towards Komodo that captain came to apologise that we were going so slowly; it seems that one of the engines had failed!&nbsp; We weren’t too concerned; being too busy devouring the sumptuous lunch the cook had prepared.&nbsp; Good cooking combines well with dragon spotting and snorkelling induced hunger.&nbsp; As we approached Komodo and our berthing place for the evening (just off Flying Fox island), the second engine started to sound strained and finally packed up too.<BR><BR>It seems the real reason to charter a boat with two engines is so that the crew can choose the easier of the two to repair!&nbsp; Whilst they were busy doing that, we were visited by two boats from the local village, who paddled over chasing the elusive tourist dollar.&nbsp; They managed to sell me a wooden carving of a Komodo dragon, but were less successful selling 1000 Yen note.&nbsp; Like all the villagers on Komodo who we met, they asked us for medicine; and seemed very happy with the Disprin we were able to offer.&nbsp; The second boat to arrive was too late for the tourist dollar, so had to be content offering advise to the crew fixing the engine.<BR><BR>As dusk set we strung up the hammock, and watched the Flying Foxes (huge bats) leave their perches in the branches overhanging the bay, and head off for the evenings hunting.&nbsp; Quite magical.&nbsp; The sea around Indonesia seems remarkably flat; it’s hard to believe you are in the middle of the ocean rather than a large lake.&nbsp; After some really good star gazing, we called it a night and dossed down on some thin mattresses on the deck, lulled to sleep by the gentle rocking of the boat, and the cool breeze blowing off the water.&nbsp; <BR><BR>All went well, until I was woken up in the middle of the night by a cockroach scuttling across my face.&nbsp; Blighters are everywhere in SE Asia, and I must be getting used to them as I was able to suppress the shrieks of horror and only wave my arms around frantically for a bit.&nbsp; After that I was forced to go and sleep in the hammock; secure in the knowledge that what my life partner didn’t know wouldn’t haunt her sleep.&nbsp; Bless her, she even agreed with me in the morning.<BR><BR>Early the next day, just after sunrise, we went for a walk with a guide on Komodo island, and were rewarded by seeing several more active Komodo dragons.&nbsp; Dragons tend to be active in the early morning and evenings.&nbsp; When we left the island one of the rangers asked for a lift back to Labaun Bajo, and we were more than happy to have him along for the ride.&nbsp; He turned out to be a very interesting gentleman, with a surprisingly good knowledge about South Africa.&nbsp; We spent a good hour of the return journey talking proudly about the flora and fauna of South Africa, and trying to describe fynbos and the Protea.&nbsp; Interesting how much more patriotic one becomes far from home.<BR><BR>We stopped at the well known pink beach (named for the colour of the sand, although the name is a bit of a stretch) for some more excellent snorkelling.&nbsp; The water is warm, the corral and fishes colourful and interesting and visibility is excellent.&nbsp; You could even watch the squid swim by from the boat.&nbsp; Definitely a better place to snorkel than chilly SA.<BR></P>
<P>Then it was back to Labaun Bajo, the repair job obviously being adequate as we made the 6 hour journey with no further mishap.&nbsp; Another spectacular sunset, an interesting discussion about Holland with Rob, and then the following morning we were whisked off to the airport.&nbsp; As we boarded the plane to Komodo, we were all immensely relieved to see that it had two engines.</P></span><!-- End_Module_431 -->
