				<i>First stop on our around the world adventure</i>
				<br />
				<i>4 - 8 February 2003</i>
				<br />By Wendy &amp; David Laing<br /><br /><b>The flight - Malaysian Airways MH202, dept CT @ 11:00SAT, arr KL @ 6:30MAT</b><br />The flight from Cape Town to Kuala Lumpur was relatively unexciting. There was, however, a very interesting in-flight information channel on the TV. It showed us various aerial shots of where the aeroplane was in relation to the land, how fast we were going, how high we were flying, what the temperature was outside, what the time was (in KL &amp; where we were at the time), how long until we landed, estimated landing time, how far away from Mecca we where &amp; in what direction it was (so you could go to the prayer room to pray) etc. etc.<br />We tried out an anti-histamine tablet (for Wendy) and a sleeping tablet (For David) on the flight, but neither of them worked. We both ended up watching movies and playing computer games in the dark (the lights are turned off and the blinds pulled down after “lunch”, to try and get everyone to sleep – only to be woken up at 4 in the morning (Malaysian time) for breakfast!).</p>
		<p>
				<b>KL, the city</b>
				<br />KL is a huge bustling city, dominated by Islamic architecture and probably has more office space than the whole of Africa. Buildings are under construction everywhere – no wonder given that the Malayasian “project” is to be fully developed by 2020 (The words "Government Project" are uttered in awed tones here - it seems to be a guarantee that something will get done, and done well). Either a building is a huge skyscraper, or a rotting single storey house. The centre of the city (called the Golden Triangle) is dominated by five star hotels, banks and shopping malls – apparently Malaysia’s national sport is shopping!<br />We stayed on the edge of the Golden triangle, in Pondok Lodge, a backpacker’s dream - it exudes cleanliness, helpful and efficient staff, airconditioning and a mavelous roof garden. (like most of South East Asia, KL is hot and humid – 30+ deg C and 80% humidity all year round).</p>
		<p>
				<b>Food</b>
				<br />Everyone seems to eat out in Malaysia, three meals a day. You can either eat at the roadside stalls with the locals (although we lost quite a few taste buds this way – even the mild versions contain chunks of chilli!), which is incredibly cheap – RM3.50 (+- ZAR8) for breakfast for both of us. Of course, there are fancy restoran (Malaysian for restaurant) that cater for the tourists which cost more; RM20 - 150 for a meal. There is a real mismash of foods – from Malaysian to Chinese to Indian to Kentucky Fried Chicken (we saw a two storey KFC!). The highlight of our culinary experience was a buffet meal, which included a performance of Malaysian cultural dancing (which wasn’t very good – explaining why Malaysian dancing hasn’t taken the world by storm).</p>
		<p>
				<b>The Menaras (Towers)</b>
				<br />KL has many Menaras (Towers), but the 2 most famous are the Petronas towers (the tallest in the world) and the KL Menara (3rd tallest telecoms tower). The 2 Petronas towers offer a free tour up to the bridge between them on the 41st story (which is imortalised in the movie "Entrapment"). The free tour is sadly disappointing – just a 2 minute blurb on who built them (Americans and Koreans) and the fact that they are 453m tall. The movie we watched while waiting to go up (Called: “Realisation of a Vision”) was much more interesting. It told us things like: the foundation was the longest continuous concrete pour in history (54hrs), there are 88 stories, and a 5,400 space car park below. The towers themselves are however, extremely beautiful from the outside. They are covered in aluminium and glass – and are always easily the shiniest buildings in the area – any time of the day. Attached to the towers (and below them), is KLCC (Kuala Lumpur City Centre) – an absolutely massive shopping centre. It has 5 stories of shops and an amazing sculpted garden and fountain outside.<br />While looking around KLCC (and enjoying the air conditioning), we decided to try and find some post cards to post home. When we asked at the Post Office, how much it would cost to post a card to South Africa, we were blown away and had to ask the lady to repeat herself. It costs only 50 sen (just over ZAR 1) to post to anywhere in the world! Down with SA's monopolistic pricing!<br />And then, just to confirm our shock, we discovered that it costs 10 sen for a local call here. It is almost free!</p>
		<p>The KL tower was one of the highlights of our trip. It costs RM 15 (+_ ZAR 35) each, but you get an audio cassette tour in your language included. We wondered around, marvelling at the panoramic view of the city and discovering interesting facts about Malaysia. One thing in particular that I didn’t know, was that Malaysia has 9 kings/sultans (one for each province), which elect a president every 5 years. This would explain the mention of kings and palaces everywhere, but the picture of the president in all over too. The movie on the KL Towers construction, was called: “The Malaysian Vision” – picking up any repeats here? We thought of going to the revolving restaurant on top of the tower for dinner, but just the buffet was RM 85 each, so we had to go back down to where mortals dine.</p>
		<p>
				<b>The Malaysian People</b>
				<br />All over KL, the people have been particularly friendly and helpful. They will try to help, even if their command of English is limited. I even managed to make a lady at the tourist centre blush because she answered the wrong question and I said: “I was wondering if you could tell me more about the cultural shows.”<br />The travel agent where we bought out Thailand air tickets (KL – Bangkok – Chiang Mai) was lovely to talk to. She went out of her way to find out about transfer from the Chiang Mai airport, visa requirements in Thailand etc. To us, she epitomised the Malaysian dream. She mentioned, with scorn, that we would probably not be able book our train tickets back to Malaysia on the Internet – because Thailand is no where near as advanced as Malaysia. The 2020 vision is everywhere. Interestingly, she was shocked to see that we are from “Africa” – she must have pictured a much darker skin colour!<br />The lady who changed our Dollars to Ringet showed up the difference between Malay and South African service. She apologised that we had to wait for 2 minutes while the bank put her through to someone who wasn’t at their desk. She was one of the many people here who say ”Dollar” when they mean Malaysian Ringget.<br />Most of the street stalls have someone who speaks English and who is willing to rush up and help us twits who are trying to figure the Malaysian menu out. Sometimes, they will be from the stall 3 stands down! But, they never push you to buy and don’t load the prices because you are so obviously a tourist.</p>
		<p>
				<b>The Batu caves</b>
				<br />The Batu caves are advertised everywhere. For the caves themselves, but mostly for the Hindus who come here once a year to perform cleansing rituals (which involve piercing themselves with hooks and then hanging something on the hook). We are proud to announce that we got brave and decided not to take the RM25 "tour" to the caves, but chose to ask around and get there ourselves – for only RM 1.60 each way on the local bus! (which was air conditioned!) The caves are also famous, unfortunately, for the 272 step flight of stairs that lead up to the entrance of the cave. And these aren’t just a normal climb, they are steeper than normal and are uneven (so a zombified David and Wendy who are dragging themselves up the stairs under the sweltering sun and humidity can do a lot of even more tiring tripping). <br />The caves were disappointing, they are dirty (the first place where we have seen any litter anywhere in KL) and very poorly looked after. The stalactites are broken off and burned everywhere. There is also nowhere to get information on the caves or their history (The KL Towers eventually helped us out here) The Hindu statues and paintings were interesting enough, although the caves really can't hold a candle to the Cango or Sudwala Caves in SA.</p>
		<p>
				<b>Muslims and mosques</b>
				<br />Whilst Malaysia guarantees religious freedom, the state religion is Islam, and most (85%) of the population are Muslims. Evidence of the influence of Islam is everywhere - most notably in the architecture. Most of the buildings are inspired by Islamic ideas - towering domes, minerettes and arches adorn many buildings, and there are mosques everywhere. We have included two of the most notable in our phots. We visited the state mosque on our last day in KL; what a majestic sight! It is really huge (like most things it seems), with the largest dome and highest minurettes in the world (at 260m+). The mosque prayer hall has three levels, and can hold 24,000 praying people. And, if that isn't enough, the outside fountain can be switched off, which makes space for a few thousand more.</p>
		<p>
		</p>
		<p>And that concluded our first week in Malaysia - now we are off to the north of Thailand, to Chiang Mai, to see if we can ride an elephant. </p>
