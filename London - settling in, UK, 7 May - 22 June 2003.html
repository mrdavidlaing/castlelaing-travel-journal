<I>Sight seeing, job hunting and catching up with friends</I> <BR>By Wendy </P>
<P>For our first 2 weeks in London, we stayed with Simon (David's friend from school) and his two house mates - René and Lee. They live in a lovely house near the East Croydon train station (on the outskirts of London, in Zone 5) - an area which is teaming with business people in pinstripes, old people with wheely bags and young girls with babies in pushchairs. </P>
<P>After managing to maintain our welcome for so long by packing the dishwasher every day, we found our very own room to stay in - in Southfields (just up from Wimbledon, South West London). We are now staying in an enormous room in a flat with 2 other South African guys. The flat is the 2nd floor of lovely old converted house, complete with spiral staircase and a couple of stained glass windows. We are 10 minutes walk from the tube station and 2 minutes from an extremely convenient bus station. We are so comfortable here (not having to move our things for nearly a month!) with satellite TV and broadband internet that we have even bought a window box and are growing our own Mr. Faulty (a very happy, healthy basil plant) and some flower seeds (who have germinated and have about 4 leaves each now). And just to shock all of our soft currency friends … the rent is a very reasonable (for London) £180 per week - over ZAR 2,000!</P>
<P>We managed to both get (minimum wage) jobs working at the Chelsea Flower show - David as a ticket tearer and me as a Safety Steward. David got to stand at an entrance all day, letting people through after tearing their tickets and I got to stand around, answering questions and reporting any First Aid incidents or potential Mr. Moby's (suspicious bags left alone that may be bombs). The show is on the Royal Chelsea hospital grounds and as a result, the gentlemen who live at the hospital are allowed to wander around freely. These wonderful old men who fought in the 2 World Wars wander around wearing spiffing black hats and red coats (bedecked with many medals of honour), saying "Hello my dear, nearly 4 o'clock. Tea time!" The show itself certainly deserves its reputation. There were 2 giant marquees which contained special flower and theme gardens (and people escaping the rain), smaller courtyard gardens (including one with flowers growing out of a Mini), larger gardens containing cottages and waterfalls and things and lots of people selling garden related things from hedge trimmers to driftwood chairs. The show cost £28 per entry and they let so many people in that it took over 30 minutes to push one's way halfway across the grounds. There were queues to see every one of the gardens and one garden was so popular that people had to stand in a queue for 2 and a half hours to see it. It was great to be able to see the show for free, particularly in the morning before everyone had arrived, but working from 7am to 8:30pm was ridiculous! My feet were eventually in so much pain that I took my shoes off and walked home in my socks. Luckily, the English are too bored to make any rude comments!</P>
<P>Fortunately for our shrivelling Rand savings, most of the museums in London are FREE. So we have been able to drive around on the bus seeing the amazing architecture, such as the Houses of Parliament and Westminster Abbey, go to a museum for the afternoon - a whole day's entertainment with only having to pay for the bus pass. The most memorable museums so far have been to the Tate Modern (visual art from 1900 onwards), Sir John Soane's house and the Science museum.</P>
<P>Our first Tate Modern experience resulted in a complete brain meltdown. We went into less than half of the exhibition rooms and had the mental stamina to study even less of the paintings, sculptures, photos and movies. Luckily David had the presence of mind to suggest that we take one of the free tours - so we went on the Landscapes tour, which included explanations of literal landscape pictures by gentlemen such as Monet and of "landscape of the mind" pieces by Salvador Dali and his contemporaries. I have always been rather fascinated by Dali's works and it was a humbling experience to see original art and sculptures (such as a lobster on a telephone!?). I am looking forward to going again when they are displaying other pieces of his that they currently have archived - maybe next year when they are having their Dali expo in May. Perhaps the most surprising thing for me was the sheer size of some of the pictures. One vaguely expects sculptures to be life-size, but to see a painting (such as Monet's Water Lilies) that is several metres in height and even more in length is almost frightening. </P>
<P>Simon took us on a whirlwind tour of the Science museum. In the few hours that we were there, we were only really able to explore the ground floor. We got to see and even touch things such as the original Stevenson's Rocket steam train and a space shuttle (with a real live astronaut telling people about his experiences). The exhibitions at the museum are interactive and genuinely interesting. They are completely the opposite of the stuffy old museum with dusty relics and 1920's explanations that I saw in SA and in South East Asia. The astronaut and engine enthusiasts were an inspired addition. It is a pity that we didn't have the time to visit the Titanic exhibition or spend more time in the electronic communications hall.</P>
<P>We were also privileged to be treated to a visit to Sir John Soane's house by Ian Pate. Very few tourists know about this one and we were lucky to have a local of 3 years to introduce us to it. Sir John Soane was an English architect about 200 years ago - he designed, amongst others, the Bank of England. In addition to this, he was more than a bit eccentric and a collector of artefacts from all over the world. One of the stranger things about his house (or more correctly, the 3 he bought and joined together) is that he and his family actually lived in it as it is now. There is a picture room whose walls open up (several times) to reveal more original paintings hidden behind them, an Egyptian room with a marble sarcophagus as the centrepiece, a room full of Roman busts and gargoyles, alcoves displaying jewellery and signet rings from various ancient monks, bookshelves squeezed in everywhere to house his 10s of thousands of books and more… One thing that was particularly bizarre (besides the mention and pictures of Fanny, the beloved lap dog, all over the house) was the fact that the tomb that he designed for his wife when she died, was the inspiration for the Red Phone Booths that one sees all over London. How creepy!</P>
<P>For the last few weeks, two of David's business colleagues from the company he started in SA (Application Junction) have been visiting and making business connections in London. We were even able to put our new found bargaining skills to good use, and get them a ridiculously cheep (by London standards) room in a hotel for their stay. It was especially convenient that the last month (ended on 15th June - pommies tend to do things between months and not from 1st to 30th) was Visit London month, so there have been lots of free exhibitions, cheap bus tickets and lots more. Last weekend we all went to the Soho festival. OK everyone breath, I know that all non-Londoner's have heard about Soho is that it is a red light district, but that is not exactly true. Yes, there are sex shops, but Soho is also the centre of all the West End Theatres, has an exciting selection of restaurants and has collector's shops (such as Betty Boop memorabilia and a Left Handed shop - hooray). During the festival, all the restaurants put tables up on the streets and had special deals, there were clowns juggling on stilts on ever street corner, live musicians and comedians. We particularly enjoyed a busker named Brian Bruno (we went back to watch him twice and bought a CD) who played his 12-string guitar and added his own style to classics like "Annie's song" with such ease.</P>
<P>As part of the Visit London month, one was able to get tickets to several live shows for half price and so after much deliberation, we decided to go and see We Will Rock You. The show was set 300 years in the future where live music is banned and GlobalSoft has taken over the world by taking away hope and replacing it with downloaded lives. But, there are rebels who are looking for a hero to find the legendary living rock and hidden musical instruments to restore hope. A rather contrived story, but the amazing costumes and lighting and of course the sensational music of Queen made it very enjoyable. </P>
<P>On a more serious side, David and I have been on the search for ways to earn Pounds since we got here. We signed up with and met several recruitment agents (those recommended or at least not despised by people we know here) and did lots of searching and applying through the web. The competition in London is stiff - the IT bubble has burst and David can now earn 20% of what he could have a few years ago, and in the Finance world, every job will receive 500 applications. Of course, the general global recession, Sep11 and the War in Iraq are not helping the London economy. But, we are please to announce that David has an 8 week contract (already done 2 weeks of it) creating an in house message management tool in ColdFusion and I had 3 interviews for jobs last week. No job offer yet, but things are looking promising. </P>
<P>Since we have been here, we have been able to see and catch up with a couple of our friends and relatives. We have been to see David's cousin Martin and Cindy and their children (including the gorgeous new addition, Simone), who live quite close to us. They have been fantastic and have not only let us use their postal address but have given us useful advice, lent us their Lonely Planet Britain and made us several wonderful suppers. We have also been able to see Mandy van den Berg, a friend of mine from primary school who I haven't seen in 12 years. It was wonderful to see her and to dust off some memories of herself and me that have been archived for so long. We have also gotten hold of my Gran and are hoping visit her for a weekend (she lives several hours drive away in Devon) sometime in July. We have also spend quite some time with Nicole Taylor and Ian Pate (who share a house with some other varisty friends near us), which has been wonderful. There are so many more people to see that it will be months before we get to see everyone, but don't despair, everyone is still on the "To see when we have a few hours free" list.</P>
<P>Phoning is so cheap here compared to SA, that it is cheaper to phone a landline in SA (mobile phones are 5 times more expensive and have disgustingly poor quality connections) than to post a letter. In fact, it is often cheaper to phone a landline in South Africa, than a mobile here. How bizarre! but good because I am horrific at writing letters (as anyone who has given up on expecting timeous replies can attest to). </P>
<P>As you can probably tell from all my waffling, living in London has been fantastic so far. We are on a tight budget, but we are loving the pleasantly warm weather, amazing architecture, museums, BROADBAND, anticipation of all the shows we are going to see, complete (if slow) transport system, etc. etc. Of course, we haven't had a winter yet (and I still need to earn real money) so we have to wait before the final verdict is out, but so far it looks like we made the right choice to come here. </P></span><!-- End_Module_437 -->
