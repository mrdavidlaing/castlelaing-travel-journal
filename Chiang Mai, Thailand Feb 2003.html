<I>Temples, trekking and good food at our second stop</I> <BR><I>8 - 16 February 2003</I> <BR>By Wendy &amp; David Laing<BR><BR></P>
<P>'Sawasdii' from Thailand.</P>
<P>KL International Airport is much more impressive by day - a huge, ultra modern (the trains speak to you) and efficient transfer point. Whilst we still weren't able to plug our laptop into the Internet, we were able to watch an episode of Buzz Lightyear before boarding our Thai Airways flight to Chiang Mai, via Bangkok.</P>
<P>As we were boarding the plane, we were already impressed with Thai Air - they had a huge selection of newspapers (in all languages) for free. During the flight, they offered us more, and there was a constant stream of air hosts and hostesses plying us with iced coffee (which is filter coffee with ice), juice and water. The food was fantastic too. David had a duck curry and Wendy had fish (Siam Bream) with basil pesto.</P>
<P>Landing at Bangkok Airport was a complete culture shock. Both the humidity and the airport standards were far lower, some of the escalators were even broken! It was just like being back at home in SA, and we instantly felt more at ease with the Thai people. Our experiences in Chiang Mai have confirmed this - Thailand is more third world than Malaysia (you just have to see the electrical wiring to believe it), and at the same time much more vibrant, happening and friendly. Whilst we have found the writing and language completely indecipherable, the people are friendly, gentle and very honest.</P>
<P>Chiang Mai is a city (pop. 250,000) in the North of Thailand, famed for its trekking to "untouched" hill tribes and through jungles, elephant riding, bamboo rafting and the highest concentration of Wats (temples) in the country. It has 700 years of documented history - many of the Wats are that old, having been built in the 13th centuary; and most looking a little worse for wear. However, they all seem to have some sort of restoration project going on (which you are of course welcome to donate to; whilst we encountered almost no beggars, all Wat's have a plethora of donation boxes, shops have donation boxes for the poor, post offices have donation boxes …). There are also many new Wats being built - we watched a young novice monk breaking glass triangles and painstakingly attaching them to the wall, a task that will surely occupy most of his novice years.</P>
<P>We hired a 125cc scooter to get around - by far the most common means of transport. One evening we went up to the temple of Doi Suthep, which is on a mountain overlooking the city. It is clear why this Wat is considered one of the most holy in Thailand - it is a staggering example of how Buddism is alive and well. There are at least 3 halls where one can go to pray to an image of Buddah - each with large golden statues, decorative roofs, golden bookshelves and incense burning. There is a large golden bell-shaped pyramid in the centre of the sanctum, with golden umbrellas at each corner. This temple also has several of the rarer Jade Buddah statues. Around the outside of the sanctum are huge statues of the elephant-shaped god, gongs, drums (on wheels) and bells. It seems that the Buddist people hang up bells within the sanctum to send their prayers for them whilst they aren't there. The outer walls of the sanctum are lined with golden Buddahs every 2 metres or so - each with their own collection of donation boxes and beautiful paintings of people worshipping behind them. The view of Chiang Mai from this temple gives one a good perspective of things. It is not surprising that this is the most frequented of the temples on a Sunday.</P>
<P>Bartering is also alive and well in Chiang Mai. Even advertised hotel room rates can be reduced by about 40% just by looking concerned at the price. We are still not particularly good at bartering (especially since things seem too cheap to us - even compared to South Africa), but there is still quite a sense of achievement when one reduces the initial price significantly. The Thai people are amazing in that, once they have agreed to a price, they won't try and raise it later - even if you produce a 1000 Baht note to buy something you bartered down to 90 Baht.</P>
<P><I>David</I> : "One evening we went to the famed night bazaar - a street packed with stalls selling all manner of goods, from knock off designer brands (a real Rolex for 600B (R120) or Windows XP for 200B (R40) - yeah right!) to banana pancakes, hammered pewter pictures and hand woven skirts. A watch caught my eye at one of the stalls, and the owner - a young Thai gentleman - eagerly started the bargaining process. Everyone has a calculator that they punch (outrageous) prices into. You then make a counter offer on the calculator, their eyes go big and round and they roll their head in disbelief, and make another slightly lower offer than the original. So the process continues until you shake your head and begin to walk away, whence they shout out a lower price, and you turn around and agree. They then try to sell you multiple items at that price. Finally, the money is exchanged and the deal is concluded - just in time for you to walk 5 metres down the road, have something else catch your eye, and repeat the process. It is an exhausting if fun affair, and I now have a rather neat watch, whose strap broke the next day 9"</P>
<P>Every second shop in Chiang Mai sells either traditional Thai massage, or trekking to "non-touristic" places. So it was only a matter of time until we took a one day trek (the price of which varies wildly, and which we got at half the first price we were quoted).</P>
<P></P>
<P>We were picked up from our guesthouse in the morning by our guide Tom (who had changed his name from Dom given that Westerners often mispronounce it in the honorific form - Kun Dom quickly becomes con-Dom). He speaks Thai, English and Japanese fluently (if with the usual dropping of the last few letters - we did a lot of "Morning excersi") and is learning some of the Hill Tribe languages as well. He was a wonderful guide because he was always willing to take photos for everyone and was happy to wait for slow poke Wendy who was having trouble up the hill.</P>
<P>Our first stop was a 2.5 km hike up a "hill" to the first Hill Tribe of the day. Once over the first extremely rickety bamboo bridge, we hiked up through a forest of (young) teak trees, bamboo and vines. Wild teak trees are now protected in Thailand and one has to ask permission to chop them down, so hopefully the forest will have giant teaks again in the future. When we finally made it up to the top, we were greeted by several dirty little faces with their hands out. This tribe has learned that tourists are rich and feel sorry for them in such rural living conditions. But, even though they don't have electricity or running water, they do watch TV with a car battery, and obviously choose to stay where they do.</P>
<P><I>Wendy</I> : "We then walked a little way down the hill to our next stop - the elephant ride. Even though Indian elephants are much smaller than African elephants, they are still huge and rather scary. Luckily, the elephant trainers have built platforms for one to climb up onto to get onto their elephant - one could never just hitch a leg over like on a horse. For most of the ride, David got to sit on the elephant's neck just behind his ears while I sat on the seat that was tied onto his back. At least elephants don't walk like camels! The swaying at that height would be nauseating. But we still had to hold on for dear life while our beautiful, peaceful elephant trundled down steep embankments and past seriously sharp cliffs. The last few metres of the ride were through a river, which the elephant rather enjoyed. He tried to remain disciplined (especially with his owner running along, clicking instructions at him), but he couldn't help a little spraying of himself (and David) in the heat. Yuck, that river water is smelly! When we got off, I was able to feed our elephant a few bananas - which he took gently by his trunk and then shoved the whole thing (peel and all) into his mouth and swallowed. The elephants are then given huge bunches of bamboo leaves to eat by their owners, something which really excites them. This was definitely an experience in a lifetime. The wonder of such power in such a peaceful giant."</P>
<P>Our next stop was lunch! We went to a tiny village and were served sweet &amp; sour vegetables, rice, cabbage soup (which was much nicer than the English version), fresh fruit and water. It was all very yummy.</P>
<P>Next stop, another Hill tribe, where we were greeted by young children holding out bead bangles and saying "Hello, 5." At least they learn useful English phrases first! This was an interesting and less touristic tribe. They still keep their pigs tied up under their houses and weave their own bright clothes. Once again though, the appeal of the untouched, noble savage was lost on us. Ogling rural people is not our favourite pastime - it didn't take long for us to get all Hill tribed out.</P>
<P>Then we drove off to what all the trekking guides in Chiang Mai call a waterfall, but which is only really a large rapid. We sat in the spray of the waterfall for a while, enjoying the cool and getting ready for the steep climb back out again. There is a couple down at the river who are real entrepreneurs. They have built several bamboo platforms that are about 10cm from the water, for which they charge 5B to sit on. They also have a little bridge leading to a hole in a rock, which has the face of a baboon and an elephant shape in it. They ask for donations for the upkeep of the bridge. They also charge to use the toilet (a common practice in Thailand) and keenly offer hot tea and coffee to anyone who chances past their stall. </P>
<P>Our final stop, was a bamboo rafting trip down the river. Here we gingerly stepped onto the middle of the raft, while our guide stood in front steering with a long bamboo pole and Kim, a fellow tourist who only spoke Japanese, steered the back of the raft. The ride was about an hour long and gave one a wonderful perspective of the jungle from below. We saw luminous green dragon flies, little yellow birds that looked like wagtails and many pumps to irrigate the fields. The long thin bamboo raft was amazingly stable and took the rapids very well. We only managed to get soaked once, when our finely tuned guide lost his concentration and managed to get us stuck on a rock, in a rapid! Kim, at the back, lost his slop and nearly fell off, while we got very wet and concerned that the raft was about to break into its individual bamboo pieces. But, we were soon ponting along smoothly again and Kim had his slop back.</P>
<P>Finally, just as we were climbing into the minibus to go back home, a guy who had taken our picture whilst on the elephant arrived and offered us developed, framed pictures. A rather smooth operation. Since we hadn't managed to get any good ones on our camera, we decided to "help feed the elephants" and bought one. An hour later, we were delivered back to the hotel, in rose-scented air conditioned comfort, tired and trekked out tourists.</P>
<P><I>David</I> : "Chiang Mai has a frightening number of Western Tourists; where we saw one a day in KL, every second person here is from Europe - most seem to be German or Dutch. We even managed to bump into someone who I had gone to school with - who is here with his girlfriend teaching English. On the trek, we met up with a Dutch security guard named Richard, who is in the money transportation business in Holland. Clearly this is worlds apart from the same job in SA - Richard doesn't even carry a gun while he is working, and earns enough to travel. We were also surprised at the number of elderly European gentlemen being accompanied by young Thai women - wives or escorts?</P>
<P>Chiang Mai has an incredible music scene - at night every second restaurant has a band pelting out excellent covers of Country and Western 60's and 70's hits, even if the English is a tad strained. One restaurant we went to has several guitarists who each perform an hour long slot each evening; another has a highly polished hard rock band performing thumping renditions of Guns &amp; Roses, ZZ Top and other metal greats. And all of this with no cover charge - a live music buff's dream.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Thai food is excellent; the coffee is thick and black, and so far we have had a fruit smoothie with almost every meal. We managed to get into a routine - banana pancakes and smoothies at one of the street vendors for breakfast, lunch at a café called JJ café, which serves fantastic Thai food (all MSG free) and of course good smoothies. All the Northern Thai cuisine seems to be deep fried, and thus too oily for our palates. Our favourite Thai dish so far is one from the centre of Thailand called Pad Thai - fried noodles with peanuts, egg, tamarind sauce and a meat - chicken, pork or prawn. Prices vary wildly - we have spent the same on breakfast at one place as we have on two Cokes at another. On the whole however, the food has been very reasonably priced."</P>
<P><I>Wendy</I> : "For Valentine's day, we thought that we would have a special dinner. Unfortunately, the river boat cruise was booked up, so we decided to try the ever popular (or at least, ever advertised) Cultural dinner - where one eats traditional Northern Thai food and watches traditional dances. We rather enjoyed the evening, even though it was extremely geared towards tourists (and to taking money off them at every turn). The more interesting dances were the Fingernail dance (where the dancers wear long gold fingernails), a dance with a Dragonfly and Buddah returned as a giant yak (who spent a lot of time frightening the audience by snapping at and rushing them) and a dance with long, slim pangas that the dancers hold in their mouths and the back of their knees. The Thai dances are all very controlled and slow. The Hill tribe dances are no more than brightly dressed up people walking around the fire or in a line, whereas some of the other dances were expressive and told stories. In general though, Thai dancing has nothing of the fervour and passion of African dancing. In fact, the only place where we have noted any strong outlet of emotion in the Thai people has been in the violent Muay Thai boxing (which is advertised with loud speakers on a taxi that drives around the streets all day, and which we saw a short demonstration of on the road on our first day here). It can best be described as a no holds barred event where each opponent tries to throw the other guy on the ground, or knock him unconscious with knee, elbow and foot blows.</P>
<P>Thai massage is similar to being trampled by an elephant. Except that it happens in a rose-scented room. They start at your feet and painfully work their way up to your neck - pushing, squeezing and stamping as they go. I am glad that I have had the experience, but I wouldn't say that it is any better than a normal South African massage (which spends less time trying to click one's toes, hips and other joints)."</P>
<P></P>
<P>We leave Chiang Mai on Sunday, on a fantastic 10 hour bus trip (the train is booked up for the next week) to Bangkok, the city of outrageous traffic. Our time in Chiang Mai has been most pleasant, and we can definitely recommend it to any one looking for a cheap holiday filled with the sights and sounds of Thailand and its fantastic people. </P></span><!-- End_Module_425 -->
