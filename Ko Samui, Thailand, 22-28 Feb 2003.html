<I>Sea, sand and snorkelling</I> <BR>By Wendy <BR><BR>The bus from Bangkok deposited us (and the just-as-sleepy contents of 2 other buses) at the Tour operator’s stop in Surat Thani at 5:30am.&nbsp; The Ko Samui (Ko, or Koh, means island) group were told that we had to wait until 8:30am before we would be off to the pier.&nbsp; As with the overwhelming majority of people that we have encountered so far in Thailand, most travellers chose to take up the time filling their lungs (and, unfortunately, ours as well) with cigarette smoke.&nbsp; It is absolutely staggering how many people (Europeans and Thais) smoke in Thailand.&nbsp; There is a law that no one is allowed to smoke in an air-conditioned building, but even this is seldom adhered to (being a valuable revenue source, the police generally leave law-breaking tourists to themselves).&nbsp; The tobacco companies (mostly Marlboro) must make an absolute killing with both the tourists and the locals across Thailand.&nbsp; We are starting to miss the stricter laws in South Africa (which have made our lungs less tolerant), where most restaurants have no smoking areas and where people wouldn’t dare to smoke on public transport.<BR><BR>The boat trip to Ko Samui took around 2 hours.&nbsp; Plenty of time for the people selling taxi rides and accommodation to explain the amazing cheapness of their wares.&nbsp; We happened to be sitting in front of an oldish American man who advised us to wait until we got to the island before committing.&nbsp; He was returning to Ko Samui to live for a few months.&nbsp; He suggested that we look at staying in Mae Nam, a much quieter beach in the north than the more popular Chaweng to the east. We decided to follow his advice - which turned out to absolutely the correct thing to do.<BR><BR>We have spent a week here on the island, taking time to relax and to do as little as we can allow ourselves to.&nbsp; Feeling the need to see everything and to do everything available becomes very tiring.&nbsp; Holidays don’t always need to be hard work!&nbsp; This week, we have spent lots of time resting, reading and swimming in the sea.&nbsp; We have stayed at a place called Shangrilah Bungalows (all accommodation here is called a “bungalow) on Mae Nam beach.&nbsp; The guide book is rather rude about Mae Nam beach – calling it “OK”, but after hiring a motorcycle and zooming all around the island, we disagree.&nbsp; The water is not at clear here, so snorkelling is not so good, but there are coconut palms all along the water.&nbsp; In our exploring, we discovered that a hammock between 2 palms on the beach was our idea of an island holiday, and Mae Nam is the only place on the island where this is possible.&nbsp; We have now purchased our own hammock and David is swinging to and fro in it reading quietly as I type. &nbsp;<BR><BR>Up till Ko Samui, we had only ever been asked if we were American, and once if we were British.&nbsp; In Mae Nam, the first person to inquire, asked if we were German.&nbsp; We were bowled off our feet!&nbsp; But it didn’t take long to find out why – Mae Nam is home away from home for Germans.&nbsp; The bungalows are over ¾ full of German families, most of whom are staying for several months at a time.&nbsp; The book shops around here have more German books than English books and the beaches are covered with less than shy German ladies (of all ages) tanning topless.&nbsp; The only non-German people staying at our little complex, are: the owners (the Thais), the South Africans (us) and the Russian group (the weird yoga &amp; trance music ones).&nbsp; The long-term holidays here have turned out to be rather convenient, because we only have to pay for our room and food eaten at the restaurant every 3 days (when she generally gives us a small discount).&nbsp; We are eating mostly at their restaurant because the people are friendly, the food is good (except for the strawberry shake, which tastes like strawberry jam and a little, but not much, ice – so sweet) and reasonably priced, we get a (day old) Bangkok Post to read and we are specifically going nowhere this week.<BR><BR>One problem with Mae Nam, is that none of the cheaper places (under 1000 Baht per room) have hot water.&nbsp; But we decided that the hammock and peace were worth the sacrifice.&nbsp; It’s not like one freezes to death here anyway.&nbsp; Although the sea is always warmer than the tap water, so cleaning the salt off is always a little breath-taking.&nbsp; All in all we are paying only slightly more in Ko Samui than we have elsewhere in Thailand.&nbsp; Accomodation for two (basic room with double bed &amp; private bathroom) – 500B (R100).&nbsp; Food (three meals a day, for two excluding alcohol which is very expensive) – 600B (R120).&nbsp; Swinging in your hammock listening to the waves with a good book – priceless.<BR><BR>On Wednesday, we purchased a snorkelling trip.&nbsp; As with most things in Thailand, there is actually only one tour operator and everyone just sells their tours.&nbsp; We managed to find a lovely lady who gave us a very good price (which was more per person than we have paid for both of us anywhere else, but speed boat rides are expensive) and we were off.&nbsp; We drove off to an island called Ko Tao, about 50km north of Samui.&nbsp; Here we got to go snorkelling in the crystal clear waters (unfortunately, along with 3 other boatloads of people) and to see some lovely fish and coral.&nbsp; There are zebra striped fish who swim near the shore and who, when you look again, have you surrounded.&nbsp; David was even bitten by a particularly frisky one.&nbsp; The problem is that the tourists feed them bread, so they are always on the lookout for a snack.&nbsp; I generally waved them away (which is difficult, because they are tame, unafraid buggers) so that I could see the more unique scenery.&nbsp; This was the first time that I have gone snorkelling where I haven’t felt claustrophobic – I think it was because we were in open water and not little rock pools.&nbsp; The water is warm and the sea life very abundant – we saw everything from coral to crabs to multicoloured fishes and sea anemones.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lunch we got on the trip was pretty good, and we had free cool drinks the whole day.&nbsp; So we were very happy about our purchase.<BR><BR>The ride back was extremely bumpy and several people felt really sick.&nbsp; We felt a little queasy, but all that really happened was that our backs got sore from the hard knocking down all the way back.&nbsp; I am not taking a high speed boat ride again in a hurry.<BR>Even though we applied copious amounts of suntan lotion, twice, we still managed to get a bit burnt on the shoulders and back (no surprise there; lying with our faces down in the water all day!).<BR><BR>On our scootering around the island, we discovered a giant Tesco’s.&nbsp; It is one of the biggest supermarkets I have ever seen, and is operating on a tiny 21km by 25km island.&nbsp; We managed to buy lots of biscuits for David, toiletries and lots of drinking water.&nbsp; In Tesco’s we could buy 6 bottles of water for 12B, whereas the next cheapest street stall we have found sells 1 for 5B, and it is not uncommon to pay 20B for 1 in a restaurant.<BR><BR>Taxis are outrageously expensive of Ko Samui.&nbsp; We can’t seem to negotiate down to less than double what we paid for trips in Chiang Mai (in the same type of vehicle) and it is not uncommon to be quoted 200B (ZAR 40) to be taken somewhere.&nbsp; It is cheaper for us to hire a scooter for 24 hours (including petrol), than to take a less than 10km trip in a taxi to Chaweng beach and back.<BR><BR>One of the advantages of staying in the same place for a while is that you have time to develop relationships with some of the local people, and learn a bit about Thai culture.&nbsp; Our waitress, whose name is Waa (as in Waa!; you’re a winner?!) spent a little time teaching us how to say thank you in Thai.&nbsp; As far as we can figure out, the suffix seems to change depending on the sex of the sayer – something we haven’t encountered before.&nbsp; At any rate, the locals seem more impressed if you thank them in Thai.&nbsp; Of course it would be more useful to impress them earlier in the bargaining process, but there you have it.&nbsp; For your edification, women say “Khop Khun Ka” (Kaapoonka) and men say “Khop Khun Krap” (Kaapoonkap).&nbsp;&nbsp; You will observe how the pronounciation differs from the spelling – its generally just better to get a local to tell you how it is said.<BR><BR></P>
<P>Tomorrow, Saturday morning, we are off to the other side of Thailand’s mainland – Ko Phi Phi, an island to the West of Southern Thailand, just south of the famous Phuket.&nbsp; We are arriving late in the afternoon, so we may have to take up one of the “very nice, cheap, cheap” offers for accommodation on the boat ride to the island... </P></span><!-- End_Module_427 -->
