<I>Alighting into the first world</I> <BR>By David <BR><BR>The second class air conditioned night train proved to be a comfortable way to travel from Malaysia to Singapore, better I’d say than first class on South African railways, and most definitely more punctual.&nbsp; Singapore is connected to mainland Malaysia by a short causeway; shortly before entering Singapore a customs official wondered down the carriage and signed our passports to indicate we had left Malaysia.&nbsp; Upon arriving on the Singapore side we had to lug all out baggage out of the train, and walk though Singapore customs.<BR><BR>We had decided that this was the best place to switch nationalities from out South African to British passports; South Africans require a visa to visit Indonesia, and we felt it was safer to be deported 500m back to Malaysia than to be turned back after flying 4 hours to get to Bali!&nbsp; The border guards regarded our virgin British passports with some scepticism, paging through them looking for our Malaysia exit stamp.&nbsp; Fortunately circumstances played to our advantage; firstly it was early in the morning so the officials were bleary eyed, and secondly our train conductor was egging everyone to be quick; clearly wanting to keep the train running on time.&nbsp; The game was nearly up when one official asked Wendy “Didn’t they stamp this passport?”, to which she could truthfully reply “No” [and omit “, they stamped my South African passport”].&nbsp; We were ushered into the country, the only casualty being the Singapore officials’ opinion of Malaysia.&nbsp; <BR><BR>Now, had we been trying to import [gasp!] chewing gum, the pooh could really have hit the fan…<BR><BR>Revelling in our change of citizenship we stifled the need to sing “God save the Queen” and re-boarded the train for the short trip to the Singapore Central Station.<BR><BR>Compared to Thailand, Malaysia stood out with its constant drive towards becoming more first world.&nbsp; Singapore it seems is where Malaysia plans to be in 20 years, with everything substantially more first world.&nbsp; It is by far the most first world country Wendy and I have been to, and our days there were a treasure chest of discovering how things should be.<BR><BR>Firstly, Singapore is clean.&nbsp; The streets are spotless, the parks are carefully gardened and all the buildings have fresh coats of paint.&nbsp; ($500 fines for littering help to keep people civilised it seems).&nbsp; Everything is clearly signposted in English, traffic flow is orderly, bridges have numbers you can call should they need any repair, and pedestrian crossings count down the number of seconds you have left to cross.<BR><BR>Public transport is excellent, with two underground lines and a plethora of busses.&nbsp; You could also charter a taxi or catch a pedal powered rickshaw; although you would need a good excuse given the quality of the other transport.&nbsp; The rickshaws are the old richer cousin of the ones you can ride in Thailand or Malaysia; well polished and sturdy looking, most sported an impressive audio system mounted below the passenger seat.<BR><BR>The drains don’t smell, you will hardly ever see a decrepit building, and we weren’t ever approached by a beggar, taxi driver or souvenir salesperson. [I lie, we were approached once by a gentleman wanting to sell us a tailored suit].&nbsp; This simple lack of touting and constant harassing was perhaps the best feature of our visit to Singapore.<BR><BR>The streetside food vendors so common to other South East Asia countries have been upgraded to sanitised food courts.&nbsp; Basically, a plethora of stalls surround a tiled area containing seats.&nbsp; Each stall has pictures of the items on its menu as part of its signage; you wonder around assembling a meal, then sit at any of the tables and enjoy.&nbsp; Afterwards you leave your cutlery and crockery at the table, and it magically seems to find its way back to the respective owners.&nbsp; A pleasant, quick and relatively cheap way to enjoy a meal; we were even able to get our pork, potatoe and vegetables separated on our plates, ala “Western” style.&nbsp; The break from yet more slop on rice/noodles was terrific.<BR><BR>We spent three nights in Singapore, in the backpacker district known as Little India (no prizes for guessing why).&nbsp; Really cheap accommodation is hard to find, but we managed to bargain the rate down at a rather tasteful two star guest house down by looking shocked at the addition of tax.&nbsp; (Years of VAT conditioning having prepared us poorly for the horrors of GST).<BR><BR>We did the usual tourist things; wondered the streets and shopping centers, visited the night zoo, caught the cable car to Sentoza island and the “underwater” aquarium and went on a guided orchid walk at the botanical gardens.&nbsp; Singapore is attempting to become the cultural hub of South East Asia; had we more time (and loot), we could have seen a stage performance of Oliver, the national orchestra or Santana.<BR><BR>The night zoo is worth a visit; although a little commercialised you are unlikely to see as many different animals up close, personal and active on any other 40 minute tram ride for ZAR100.&nbsp; As we’ve seen the real things before, the lions, hyenas and elephants weren’t all that exciting; we really enjoyed seeing a tapir, the worlds largest rodent (a South American jungle rat – the size of&nbsp; full grown pig) and giant fruit bats.&nbsp; Most of the animals looked in excellent health, and much more tolerant of the screaming Japanese brats with their squeaky shoes than we were.&nbsp; The only animals that looked a little restless were the leopards; clearly they hadn’t been fed their ration of squeaky brat for the day, and we couldn’t figure out how to get one into the cage without being fined for littering.<BR><BR>Singapore is a garden city, full of trees, creepers and flowers.&nbsp; At the Singapore botanical gardens we took a guided tour of the National Orchid gardens given by a local enthusiast.&nbsp; Two local enthusiasts (and their 5 year old daughter) waxed lyrical about orchids; their Latin names, who hybridized them and when, which family they belong too; when they flower, and who bought which varieties when for how much.&nbsp; After almost two hours we had:<BR></P>
<OL>
<LI>Learnt a remarkable amount about a flower (genis?) we had hardly glanced at twice before.&nbsp; Did you know that the world’s largest orchid grows to over 1 ton in weight, pineapples belong to the Bromeliad family, bananas to the ginger family, and that there is an orchid named after Nelson Mandela and another after FW De Klerk.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also an American Express orchid… 
<LI>Seen more orchids than you can possibly imagine 
<LI>Realised that fanaticism of any kind is bad, bad, bad! </LI></OL><BR>You can catch a cable car through the World Trade tower and over the harbour to Singapore’s only resort island, Sentosa.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is quite a spectacular ride, accompanied by an informative audio guide and a cool breeze.&nbsp; Singapore harbour is one of the world’s busiest; a ship arrives or departs every six minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp; During our cable car ride, we saw two luxury cruise ships depart.&nbsp; <BR><BR>Once on the island you wizz around on the free monorail or busses, to one of the 8 main (not free) attractions on the island.&nbsp; We went to see the pink dolphin show (that apparently go completely pink when fully grown; the ones we saw were only half pink), and the underwater aquarium.&nbsp; In the underwater aquarium you stand on a conveyor belt that takes you through a glass tunnel underneath the aquarium.&nbsp; As in the recent LG commercial that was filmed there, the sight of mantis rays drifting overhead, moving through schools of fish and shoals of huge tuna, gazing the lazy nurse sharks in the eye and watching the dugong grazing all spectacular.&nbsp; So spectacular we remained on the conveyor belt for four revolutions until they turned the lights off.&nbsp; (This is part of the show; you get a torch which you can shine into the fishes eyes).&nbsp; We also saw some impressive “sea dragons”, watched cuttlefish zap their food chameleon style from sticks held in the water as they were fed, and saw live shark purses showing six stages of development.&nbsp;&nbsp; Definitely worth the entrance fees.<BR><BR>The only thing lacking in Singapore is second hand fiction bookshops. Second hand textbook shops abound; little surprise since school is from 08:00 – 18:00, six days a week, and many children have after school tutors too (!!)<BR><BR>Singapore airport is amazing; not only can you get there by the underground (culling an entire breed of blood sucking transportation leeches), but Internet access is free (wireless or with a wire) for those who have their own laptops, and is the fastest we have ever experienced.&nbsp; The airport also has a pool, places you can watch a DVD whilst waiting and areas with dim lights and reclining chairs to sleep off some jetlag. We were so enraptured by the place, that we donated our second last set of nailclippers to the extremely thourough security guards whilst checking in.&nbsp; It only took us and a security guard three unpackings to locate the scissors, which had slipped into the bottom of one of our bags.<BR><BR>Life in the first world was a pleasant break.&nbsp; Whilst watching the evening news on the bus(!), we watched a programme similar to Carte Blanch, which exposed the horrors of a woman and her three sisters being cheated out of $2 by the bus system, and a child who had drowned in recent floods whilst playing in the storm water drain that authorities still hadn’t enclosed&nbsp;&nbsp; Goes to show how everything in life is relative; and that a dictatorial one man state isn’t necessarily all bad.<BR><BR>One interesting thing we noticed was the constant use of the word “alight”.&nbsp; All the public notices and announcements are in English, and the constantly refer to alighting from things.&nbsp; You are warned to “Be careful alighting the bus”, “Stand aside for alighting passengers”, to “Please alight at this station to catch the connecting train”.&nbsp; We found this quite humorous; it will be interesting to see if this is a word used commonly in the first world, or just a Singaporian peculiarity.<BR><BR>
<P>Next destination, Bali, Indonesia.&nbsp; Given that the Australian government has over 30 countries (including Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand) on its list of places not to visit, and the British government has warned us not to go to South Africa, we are taking their travel warnings with a pinch of salt. </P></span><!-- End_Module_430 -->
