<I>Mishap and adventure in paradise</I> <BR>By David<BR><BR>Transport is Thailand is regular, cheap, and - right until our last days in Thailand – comfortable and reliable.&nbsp; Travel agents are a dime a dozen, and booking anything other than the train more than a day in advance is almost unheard of.&nbsp; In fact, as you walk down the street you sometimes need to beat off the various touts trying to get you into their travel agent.&nbsp; (Hold out ‘til someone offers you free water!).<BR><BR>By far the most common means of long distance transport in Thailand is the V.I.P bus, which is basically a single decker bus identical to the InterCape or Translux busses of South Africa (although they seem to be privately owned).&nbsp; The government also runs a bus service, which for only a little bit more is far more comfortable (twice as much leg room), reserves seats, and plies you with “snacks” during the journey.&nbsp; However, the prices are higher, it can be difficult to find the ticket office, and the in-bus movie isn’t in English.&nbsp; An air-con van, as it turns out, is an air-conditioned minibus taxi that - although it has fewer and more spacious seats - shares the maintenance and driving characteristics of its South African cousins.<BR><BR>Travel by sea between the islands is almost always by ferry, which is almost identical to the V.I.P bus in standard, albeit higher in price.<BR><BR>We left Ko Samui early in the morning and caught the ferry back to the mainland.&nbsp; We were then transferred to a V.I.P bus, and driven across the trunk of Thailand to Krabi, on the west coast.&nbsp; Conditioned air is generally scented – Thailand generally smells of roses or mint it seems.&nbsp; Our bus however, had the marvellous new ode de toilette scent, which, combined with the awful in-bus AV system (all busses seem to have DVD players – pirated discs combined with low quality components however, do not live up to any kind of higher playback quality standards) made for a less than pleasant 3 hour journey.<BR><BR>When we arrived in Krabi, we were driven to a restaurant slightly out of town to wait for the connecting ferry to Ko Phi Phi.&nbsp; This is a fairly normal practise during trips; being delivered to bus company partners for meals and other in trip purchases.&nbsp; Monopolistic as it may seem, we generally found these places good quality and reasonably priced; quite unlike the “cinema snack cartel” you might expect.<BR><BR>Several hours and a ferry ride later we were delivered to the island of Ko Phi Phi.&nbsp; If you have seen the movie The Beach, you will have seen the large palm tree covered tombola beach that contains the main town area.&nbsp; Ko Phi Phi was also apparently used in the filming of a Bond movie, although Sean Connery seems to have had less of an impact than Leonardo de Caprio.&nbsp; In Bangkok fashion, many restaurants show movies.&nbsp; If you time your eating well, you could watch The Beach twice on any given day. (We chose to watch the new Bond movie, which we still hadn’t seen, instead)<BR><BR>The island of Phi Phi is much smaller than Ko Samui – there are for example no cars since you can walk the breadth of the “town” in 15 minutes.&nbsp; In many ways it is more beautiful than Ko Samui; with majestic white cliffs soaring up out of the sea; palm tree lined white beaches and warm, clear, blue and turquoise waters to swim in.&nbsp; The jungle vegetation seems typical for the region, except with a complete absence of grass.&nbsp; The island is overrun with cats – we saw more cats and kittens that in the rest of Thailand combined.<BR><BR>Ko Phi Phi was also the most expensive place we visited in Thailand.&nbsp; The beach front is dominated by resort hotels, which charge four times what we had been paying in Ko Samui.&nbsp; We ended up staying in the middle of town, well away (all of 5 minute’s walk) from the beach for the first two nights in what was a charming but mosquito infested semi-detached room, for only a little bit more that our beach front bungalow has cost in Ko Samui.&nbsp; We decided to upgrade for the next three nights, and checked into one of the local upper class resorts for a well earned break from all the travelling (tee hee).&nbsp; With a bit of bargaining, the extra cost of the resort wasn’t all that bad given the many extra facilities and the inclusive buffet breakfast (from which you can sneak snacks for lunch).&nbsp; We certainly enjoyed lounging around the pool, basking in the sun, swimming in the pool and watching tides ebb and flow in the bay.&nbsp; The picture of Wendy in the pool will definitely get blown up and hung on a wall some day.&nbsp; (P.P. Princess Resort @ ZAR 200 pps, incl. breakfast; for those looking for a weeks’ vacation).<BR><BR>In the middle of our stay, rather than take another guided speedboat tour, we decided to hire a bright yellow two person sea kayak and two pairs of snorkels and fins and explore Ko Phi Phi under our own steam.&nbsp; Piloting the kayak turned out to be quite simple (at least it was quite simple not to fall off), but steering was another more clumsy affair.&nbsp; And it was this fact that contributed directly to the first tragic loss of our adventures so far.<BR><BR>Just as we had moved into deeper water, and were paddling along next to one of the huge white limestone cliffs that form the island, Wendy’s hat was caressed off her head by a sudden gust of wind and landed a few feet behind us in the sea.&nbsp; While we struggled to turn the kayak around, the hat began to sink almost immediately.&nbsp; By the time we had manoeuvred into range, we just couldn’t reach it with our paddles.&nbsp; I donned a snorkel and mask and bravely dove to try to retrieve the hat whilst Wendy tried vainly to keep the kayak from hitting the aforementioned white cliffs.&nbsp; Tragically the hat seemed to have been caught in an underwater current and whisked down into the murky depths (quite a feat given their normal crystal quality).&nbsp; All I was able to find was the first of a rather large school of little fish that we encountered snorkelling that day.&nbsp; Much to everyone’s relief I made it back to the kayak and managed to get aboard without capsizing and sending the rest of our stuff down to join the hat.<BR><BR>The rest of the day was uneventful, and we were able to replace the hat that evening at the night market for a ridiculously small amount; as anyone will tell you, clothes are very cheep in Thailand.&nbsp; Baring that one incident, the rest of or stay on Ko Phi Phi was of your typical island paradise variety, complete with live band, good suntans and banana pancakes.&nbsp; Pity about the stench of sewage that arrived every evening around 9pm…<BR><BR>While on the island we booked a ferry and connecting “bus” to Hat Yai, on route to exiting Thailand at Sungai Kolok in the south east.&nbsp; The ferry was so full we ended up sitting on other people’s bags in the luggage space; it seems it pays to be early when you have unreserved seating. When we arrived in Krabi and transferred to the “bus” we discovered the subtle distinction between a bus and V.I.P bus; as we were loaded into a minibus taxi.&nbsp; Fortunately there were only eleven of us, the air conditioning sort of worked, and soon we were speeding along the road to Hat Yai.<BR><BR>In general the roads in Thailand are very good, except on occasion when you need to drive down a dirt track to get from one freeway to the next.&nbsp; Rather than abandon the old road when building a newer one, Thais typically keep both; a practise that means most roads are dual carriage way freeways.&nbsp; Good in a country where it seems quite acceptable to overtake into oncoming traffic so long as you hoot loudly enough.<BR><BR>At any rate, we were zooming down one such freeway, having successfully executed several of these passing manoeuvres and with Wendy squeezed in the front with a rather tattooed German when the engine cut out and we coasted to a halt.&nbsp; Fortunately we had only been going for 45 minutes, since we now had to wait for another minibus to come and collect us.&nbsp; But it turned out to be quite and interesting wait, complete with at least 4 other [full] minibuses pulling over to offer to help out our driver (for the right price of course), and the visit of an ice-cream salesman (who sold the worst ice-cream ever).&nbsp;&nbsp; It also gave us time to get to know a Canadian fellow who was at the start of a 48 hour journey to the middle of the Canadian winter.<BR><BR>We arrived safely in Hat Yai a few hours later, and booked into what was to become the cheapest accommodation on our trip (the first time that the guide book has been correct with pricing in Thailand); a large room with fan and private bathroom, including western flushing toilet but excluding a [usable] window for the princely sum of 75B (ZAR15) pps.&nbsp; Finding Hat Yai to be fairly uninteresting (the big attraction is apparently for those with a snake fetish; you can drink snake blood or have snake soup at one of the markets), we only stayed long enough to singe our taste buds one last time before catching the early morning train to the border at Sungai Kolok the next morning.<BR><BR></P>
<P>We were pleasantly surprised at the quality of second class; extremely clean, spacious and cool.&nbsp;&nbsp; The border to Malaysia is a one kilometre walk from the train station; and with the Thai immigration official having asked us if we knew his good friend Nelson Mandela, we walked into Malaysia, and caught the bus to Kota Bharu; the start of the Jungle Railway through the centre of Malaysia.</P></span><!-- End_Module_428 -->
