<I>Unexpected adventures, a new culture and rain.</I> <BR>By Wendy </P>
<P>We landed in Padang, the capital of West Sumatra on Sunday afternoon, hoping to get to the bus terminal, ride to Bukit Tinggi, spend the night and then take a bus up to Lake Toba (the original reason why we decided to visit Indonesia) the following day. However…</P>
<P>As we were the only tourists on the plane, we were swamped by taxi drivers when we left the terminal. Luckily, we had gotten a voucher for a taxi to take us to the bus terminal in the building already and all we needed to do was find the car with the correct number in his window. Whilst being mobbed however, an Indonesian fellow with a briefcase asked me where we were going. I thought he was another taxi driver trying to overcharge me, so I said Bukit Tinggi and turned away. But as it turns out, he was a fellow traveller who was also going to Bukit Tinggi (the name means town at the top of the hill) and he asked to share out taxi. We agreed, but then he wanted to take a taxi all the way (a 2-hour ride – we hesitated to guess how much that would be). When this breed of sharks told him the price, he nearly fainted, but when we told him how much they were going to charge us to get to the bus terminal, he lost his temper with them. We just shrugged, used to being the ATM for the locals and he eventually said he would share the taxi with us.</P>
<P>As soon as we had left the airport ground, Redo (that’s our new-found friend’s name) jumped out to use a Wartel (a public phone shop), we assumed he was phoning home to say he had landed. Back in the taxi and after some angry words with the taxi driver, we were off again. Redo (who was sitting in front) turned around to introduce himself.</P>
<P>Redo is 37 (the third person we have spent time with in Indonesia and the third 37 year-old – what a coincidence!) and has a wife and 3 children. He was coming home after a month working in Jakarta, to pack up the family and move to Dubai for 2 years. There, besides earning fantastic amounts of money, he is going to supervise Indonesians to work in Dubai as house maids and the like. Redo can speak and write fluent Arabic and although he apologised for his English, his command of this 3rd is also pretty good. (Also, should anyone want to walk for an English language Indonesian radio station, he’s the man to talk to. Speak to us for his address.)</P>
<P>After some time, I began to wonder if we had communicated correctly with the taxi driver because it felt as if we had driven further than the 8km to the bus terminal. Not long afterwards, Redo announced that he had told the taxi driver to take us to his friend’s house to pick up his car, so he could drive us to Bukit Tinggi. We were a bit surprised, to say the least. But we agreed - since he was a nice enough fellow, and now was as good a time as any to have an adventure.</P>
<P>Redo’s car is a 1968 Corona which has most definitely seen better days. The insides of the doors are missing, some windows don’t wind down and some don’t wind up, it has only one windscreen wiper, a fuel gauge that is stuck on FULL, leaks in several places, no fan, has problems getting into first etc. etc.<BR><BR>But it does chug along quite well up the mountains.</P>
<P></P>
<P>While we were waiting outside for Redo to talk to his friend, we spotted a friend banana salesman and in a moment of complete inspiration, bought 3. We hadn’t had lunch (besides the few airplane snacks) and it was already 4 o’clock. Little did we know that we wouldn’t eat again until after 9pm.</P>
<P>When we went to fill up with petrol, Redo asked if we could pay for the petrol and he would reciprocate with a night’s free accommodation at his sister’s Homestay. (Now this was really turning into an adventure!) Now we knew why he had seemed so desperate to share a taxi with us – he had almost no cash on him. We quite liked him and decided to give him the benefit of the doubt, so we agreed. I’m still not sure whether his sister was pleased with his offer though.</P>
<P>The guide book and Redo both describe the views on the drive between Padang and Bukit Tinggi as spectacular, and I have to agree. We wound around the mountainous, jungled terrain, sometimes at the top of the world and sometimes at the bottom looking up at the splendid volcanoes. Unfortunately, it began to rain almost as soon as we had set off and as Bukit Tinggi grew closer, so did the heavy rain close in on us.</P>
<P>As previously mentioned, Redo’s car only has one windscreen wiper. This over-worked little guy is however, positioned on the passenger side of the windscreen. So Redo was forced to lean over with his head almost on David’s shoulder just to be able to see where he was going. I was sitting on the back seat, furiously covering the laptop with a plastic bag and trying to sit in the areas where it wasn’t raining in on me (eventually, I looked like I was playing a game of Twister!). Unfortunately, the little wiper began to give up his ghost and eventually when Redo was getting out of the car and into the sheeting down rain every 10 metres to try to get it working again, he decided to admit defeat.</P>
<P>We pulled into a place where some guys were fixing a car (I don’t know if it was a garage or a homestead) and Redo was forced to borrow another Rp 10,000 (ZAR 10) from us to phone home. By this time, he was extremely embarrassed and promised to pay us back as soon as we got to his house – which he casually mentioned, was in a small village just outside Bukit Tinggi.</P>
<P>The “mechanics” applied some pressure on the wiper with a pair of pliers and we were off again, planning to drive slowly until his friend whom he’d phoned met us on the road. At this stage, I was still under the impression that it took 2 hours to drive to Bukit Tinggi, so I reckoned that we should meet his friend in about half an hour, swap cars and only lose about and hour altogether. Luckily, I was ignorant.</P>
<P>To everyone’s great delight, the little wiper held his own (it was now wiping the middle and driver’s side of the windscreen) and not long later, the rain calmed down to a strong drizzle. We decided that we would make it on our own and phoned Redo’s friend to thank him for his troubles.</P>
<P>After about 3 hours of driving, we reached the outskirts of Bukit Tinggi and the sun was almost set. Redo confirmed with us that we would go to his village just outside the town to get the Rp 10,000 he owed us and then to go to his sister’s homestay for the night. About an hour later, we eventually arrived in Payakumbuh and at Redo’s house. By this time he was smiling broadly and saying how excited he was to see his wife again – it was wonderful to see.</P>
<P>At this stage, I had been envisioning perhaps having a dinner with his family and trying to speak some Indonesian. I was wondering if his wife was one of the many defensive Muslim women we have met in Indonesia, or if she would be open and friendly like Redo. I was wondering if we would shiver in a hole all night or if we would like the homestay. Who knew?</P>
<P>At Redo’s home, each of his children took our hand and placed it ceremoniously on their forehead in greeting. His wife smiled and said hello and we were asked in for tea. We sat in the living room, smiling sheepishly at his brother-in-law while he and his wife made tea. When it arrived, I was careful to use my right hand to pick the glass up with and to drink with (it is customary to only eat with the right hand).</P>
<P>Surprisingly, just before we had finished drinking, we were rushed into his brother-in-law’s minivan and off we went. Subtly, Redo mentioned that it was ONLY 15km away (that is at least half an hour’s drive)! He told us he’d see us the next day and we were off. By this time, I was starving and tired and cold. But we eventually got to the homestay, woke Redo’s sister up (I bet she had some things to say to him the next day) and were shown to a little hut. Luckily, they agreed to make us supper (even though it was after 9pm).</P>
<P>In our room later, we scrutinised the guide book’s descriptions and map and eventually decided that we must be in Harau valley – a place that the guide book says is very difficult to get to – unless of course you happen to meet an Indonesian who is going there and who has a sister who owns the only guest house in the area!</P>
<P>Harau valley is surrounded by 100m high vertical cliffs (our guest house was imaginatively called “Echo” Homestay). The land valley is sparsely populated with self-sufficient homesteads and their many rice paddies. While it wasn’t raining (a very rare occurrence during our 2 days there) we went for a walk to see the scenery and to visit some of their impressive waterfalls. We were lucky to arrive at one when no one (it is a popular hang-out) was there and so we went for a rather cold shower under the waterfall. Having fallen 100m, the water reaches your head with quite a thud! It was a lovely experience to be there in the middle of the jungle with crystal clear water flowing about.</P>
<P>Just as we were drying off, some teenagers arrived for a swim. In true Indonesian fashion, they stripped down to their jeans and sat in the water, washing their hair!</P>
<P>Most West Sumatrans are part of the Minang Kabau people. Their culture is most interesting because it is a matriarchal society – the only right a man has is to ask his wife to be faithful. The men move in with their wife’s family when they get married and it is the oldest woman who owns the house and makes the all decisions. It is still not clear to me how they reconcile this tradition with the fact that they are now nearly all Muslims (a male-dominated faith).</P>
<P>Minang Kabau houses are intricately carved, rectangular beauties; each with a roof shaped like buffalo horns (with 2 high spires on either end and a dip in the middle). The walls lean outwards, making them look a little like ships. They are usually built on stilts, leaving an area underneath for the animals to shelter themselves. </P>
<P>The bright colours that these people traditionally wear and paint their houses is reflected in their dancing – which includes jumping on broken glass, simulating stalking and killing a tiger and mock fights. Their bull fighting is much tamer though and only entails 2 water buffalo’s staring each other out and knocking each other’s horns until one gives up.</P>
<P>We weren’t sure if Alison - our travel agent - had managed to book our KL – London flight yet and since we had told her that anything from the 25th April (it was already around the 17th and travel in Sumatra is EXTREMELY slow), we needed to get to a place to use the Internet to find out. The trip back to Bukit Tinggi involved taking a white opelet (converted minibus) to the market in Payakumbuh, a blue opelet to the bus terminal and then a bigger bus to Bukit Tinggi. We were supposed to take a red opelet into the town centre from there, but we had forgotten that part of the instructions by the time we got there (and ended up walking nearly 5km in the midday heat as a result).</P>
<P>Bukit Tinggi is a lovely small town which is situated high in the mountains (and is thus nice and cool). The town is surrounded by 3 volcanoes, the most active of which is called Merapi. There are volcanoes right across Indonesia with that name, which made complete sense when we were told that the word means Red Fire. Unfortunately, it is also victim to a common Indonesian scourge – uncovered drains and the accompanying smells and dangers to one’s ankles.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, we picked a hotel that was almost exactly between 2 mosques and so we were woken up before dawn every morning with the two criers trying to drown one another out and to make the rest of us deaf. The process was naturally, repeated another 4 times every day – so no afternoon naps for Wendy!</P>
<P>Whilst in Bukit Tinggi, we decided to take a day trip to learn a bit more about the West Sumatran way of life. This trip took us to see the King’s palace which had to be completely rebuilt after rioting Sumatrans burnt it down in the 1960’s (I am convinced that in the next few decades, Indonesia is going to give up and become several hundred small countries again). The palace was definitely the nicest that we have seen on our travels - the inside was lusciously decorated with bright wall hangings and cushions, each of the last King’s (his reign ended in 1850 or so) 9 daughters and their husbands had their own bedrooms, the ceiling was intricately carved, all in all it looked like a splendid place to live. I just have one question, why did they have a king and not a queen?</P>
<P>In this palace, one can rent some traditional Minang Kabau clothes to wear. Usually, the locals rent them for wedding ceremonies and the like. We decided to splash out and I rented some clothes for a photo shoot around the castle. The staff all loved it and kept of suggesting that “her majesty” have her photo taken at that window and wouldn’t “her majesty” like to stand next to the previous king’s picture? It was great fun! I chose a blue and gold outfit – basically a sarong, a long-sleeved top that is tied at the back, a giant collar, a buffalo horn shaped hat and lots of dangly gold bits.</P>
<P>During our tour, we also stopped at several places to have a look at some of the crops that the Minang Kabau grow. It was most educational, we got to see: </P>
<UL>
<LI>coffee shrubs - and the beans are NOT sweet before they are ripe as the Indonesians seem to think 
<LI>clove trees - even the leaves taste and smell like clove. Indonesia has now become a net importer of cloves because the locals love to smoke clove-scented cigarettes (and ALL males smoke and many women do to) 
<LI>cinnamon trees - beautiful trees whose leaves are pink when they are young 
<LI>nifty mimosa plants - that curl away and close their leaves when you touch them 
<LI>lots of kinds of chillies - which grow slowly and take “as long as” 4 months before they begin produce fruit and which thus need to have plastic around them to stop other plants strangling them to death while they are small 
<LI>jackfruit – which grow on trees and get bigger than watermelons, unripe jackfruit tastes delicious: similar to very soft stewed beef 
<LI>cotton – so white and growing in such dirty conditions 
<LI>morning glory – a lovely purple flower that grows as a weed in South Africa and which turns turquoise when one holds a cigarette to it (the nicotine reacts with the flower) </LI></UL>and the usual banana (which produces one bunch within a year and is then chopped down), rice, pineapples, coconuts, tomatoes etc. We also went to a factory to see them make ginger coffee (ginger &amp; coffee ground together) and boiled fruit sweets. Yum! 
<P>On our tour we met a lovely New Zealand couple called Mark and Jenni. They have been travelling around for years and even spent 3 months in India (the first people I’ve met who enjoyed the experience). Having just come from earning money in London, they were also kind enough to give us some useful advice about living and staying there. Mark and Jenny had some trouble leaving Bukit Tinggi; the road they were travelling on kept getting washed away. We didn’t see them after the third time they said farewell; and we received an email a while later from NZ, so they must have gotten home safely.</P>
<P>The hotel owner, guide and restaurateurs all tried to talk us into taking a 10day trip to an island just off West Sumatra to see the “primitive people”. After our short experience in Thailand, we definitely don’t want to do that again. First of all, the people are not primitive anymore, they have been exposed to TV’s and cell phones and other technologies just like the rest of us and secondly, I’d rather not eat monkey brains and locusts and not bath for 10 days.</P>
<P>After a day or 2 in Bukit Tinggi, we popped onto a public bus and were soon on our way down to Lake Maningau (which is so deep - 480m, the bottom is nearly at sea level). Travelling on a public bus is a very communal experience. The bus putts along and stops for anyone at any time. There are guitar players and food sellers at all the major stops and the bus is jam packed with school children, old people, babies, young guys (all smoking naturally) etc. The busses are gaily painted with various superhero pictures, and USA and British flags, and they pump heavy metal tunes through the speakers, which are just next to the tissue boxes on the roof. The seats are designed for Indonesians so even my little legs have trouble fitting in the gap between my seat and the one in front of me, but the bus attendants are very helpful and even climb up to the roof to get your bags out from under the tarpaulin in the pouring rain. Plus, it is very cheap.</P>
<P>The drive down to the lake includes a fantastic 44 hairpin turn single-lane (not that busses worry about that sort of inconvenience) road which is in surprisingly good repair. It provides one with a lovely view of the crater lake and surrounding jungle (assuming it isn’t raining, which it was on both there and back).</P>
<P>We stayed in Maningau for 4 nights and it rained nearly all of the time. Not just little drizzly stuff, but big pounding drops that obscured one’s visions past one’s nose. In fact, the hotel that we stayed on was so close to the lake that we were very close to having our room flooded while we were there. Whenever the wind whipped up, the water splashed onto our doorstep. The rest of the time, fish were swimming around on the steps below.</P>
<P>Every now and again, the rain stopped for a few minutes and we tried to time our dashes to get food to coincide with these rare occasions. Unfortunately, the low tourism in the area has resulted in nearly all of the restaurants having almost nothing to eat. It was extremely annoying that firstly, the restaurant hadn’t reduced their menu to a piece of paper stating what they actually had and secondly that the waiter would take and order and only come back half an hour later to announce that they didn’t actually have chicken, cheese or toast. This happened to a lesser extent in Bukkit Tinggi; at one stage David ordered a “special” taco with guacamole and cheese. When it finally arrived an hour later, the waiter apologised that there was no cheese or guacamole; he then said “I guess it isn’t so special after all”. On another night, we were loured into a shop that advertised “pizza and apple pie” on a large board outside; only to discover they had neither.</P>
<P>Back in Minanjau, we found a lovely restaurant were the people were very friendly and where we could actually get food. We had a good giggle one evening when we ordered Bar-B-Q fish and we were asked if we minded waiting an hour for our food to be prepared – we have never waited less than an hour before anyway! The fish was amazing. You ordered it and a few moments later someone came walking past with a net containing fresh, live fish from their fish farm. The wait was definitely worth it. And we only had to pay ZAR 20 for a whole fish (30cm long including the usual tail and head), rice, chips (potatoes count as veges in the East) and vegetables.</P>
<P>One afternoon we hired a little dugout to row around a bit. Our plan was to row 1km down the lake to the next town which apparently had some beaches (and not just slimy steps into the lake). But we spent most of the time doing 360’s, so we ended up not going very far at all. On this journey though, we were able to take a good look at the fish farming around the lake. The farmers float palm leaves in the water with some old water bottles to attract little fish. They then collect these little dudes and transfer them to submerged nets that are held up with bamboo. The fish are fed and grow very well in the lake water. There must be some exporting happening here because there are so many fish in these farms that even with everyone eating several fish every day, they wouldn’t all be eaten. The farmers who were all gaily fishing over the sides of their farms (I suppose they find it fun because they definitely don’t need to catch wild ones) and were happy to show us their fish (and of course try to sell us some accommodation, a trek or a taxi journey).</P>
<P>A week after we had arrived in West Sumatra (when our original plan was to stay one day), we caught the bus back to Bukit Tinggi and bought an Executive class (just as cramped as ordinary class – with people sitting on stools in the aisles – but with freezing cold air-con) ticket to Parapat, on the shores of Lake Toba.</P>
<P>On the way, we stopped off for dinner at a Padang restaurant (yes, this way of serving food originates in the capital of West Sumatra: Padang). Padang is most certainly the fastest of fast food. The waiter notices you moving towards a table and before you have sat down, you have a plate of rice in front of you. There is also a bowl of water to wash your hands, some freshly boiled (and still hot) water to drink and several plates of different things to eat placed on the table. Naturally, you must eat with your right hand (the left hand being unsavoury), which caused a slight problem for me. We chose the least chilli items in front of us – chicken pieces and some eggs boiled in chilli. Both were cold but very good. We also ordered some “teh susu”, which is tea with condensed milk – my new favourite drink and the first drink that I can order in Indonesian.</P>
<P>Although you only pay for what you eat, Padang food is almost as expensive as other meals here, but it is even faster than McDonalds and MUCH healthier. </P></span><!-- End_Module_434 -->
