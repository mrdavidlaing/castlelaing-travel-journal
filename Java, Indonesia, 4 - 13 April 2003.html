<I>Ancient temples, hard selling and active volcanoes.</I> <BR>By David<BR><BR>Travelling by bus in Indonesia turns out to be a rather harrowing affair.&nbsp; Not that there is anything to complain about with the service, or the price.&nbsp; Executive and Super Executive class are akin to flying economy and business class respectively; from seat size to being fed.&nbsp; (In fact they seem to insist on feeding you while travelling here; at one point we were kicked off the bus to go and eat a free buffet meal!).&nbsp; However; it’s travelling by road that is the problem.&nbsp; On our trip from Bali to Yogyakarta in Java, we unfortunately sat in the front, and so could see all the near misses of people and people on motorbikes, the wild overtaking on blind rises and corners (just hoot and hope!), and swerving around potholes.&nbsp; <BR><BR>Java is the most built up island of Indonesia, and as such boasts the trans-Java highway.&nbsp; Something of an overstatement; the road is a tiny verge-less thing, that winds its way through every village, in and out of every hill, and through every pothole.&nbsp; The road teams with traffic, from horse drawn carts to pantecknikons.&nbsp; But, all of that aside, travelling by bus is quite an experience.&nbsp; To get from Bali to Java, the bus drives aboard a ferry for a 30 minute sea crossing.&nbsp; Watching the driver park the bus on the ferry, and then manoeuvre the bus off the ferry over a moving gangplank instilled heightened levels of respect in all passengers. <BR><BR>The rest of our travels around Java were by train.&nbsp; This is a much quicker and more pleasant way to travel, even if the trains aren’t quite as nice as those in Malaysia and Thailand.<BR><BR>We spent 5 days in Yogyakarta, the cultural capital of Java, and hence of Indonesia.&nbsp; Yogya (as everyone calls it) also enjoys being a separate province due to some historical abnormalities including the sultan and the Dutch.&nbsp; As such, it is a very pleasant laid back kind of place, and having most of the Indonesia’s universities it is full of young people, arts and crafts and more batik than you can shake a stick at.<BR><BR>The guidebook warns that anybody who talks to you on the street will probably end up trying to get you into a batik gallery.&nbsp; They warn that these touts are quite unscrupulous, telling you the place you are going to is closed, or that its name as changed to the place they want you to go to, or that this is the last day for a particular exhibition.&nbsp;&nbsp; On our first day, on our way to the tourist office we laughed off the first guy who told us it was closed (it wasn’t), and the second guy who tried to get us to go to the last day of his special government exhibition.&nbsp; However, we were eventually lured into a gallery of student artists (well, that’s what they said), and given a very informative tour of the art of batik painting by a well spoken young artist.&nbsp; Impressed by the quality of the work, we eventually ended up buying two pieces.&nbsp; On reflection we were probably hustled; however the artwork is very good and I’m sure we will always enjoy it.&nbsp; It is also very easy to transport, folding up into a little bag.<BR>Within daytrip distance of Yogya lie two of Indonesia’s most impressive temple complexes; the Buddhist mandala of Borobudur (<A class=moz-txt-link-abbreviated href="http://www.borobudur.com/">www.borobudur.com</A>) to the west and the Hindu Candi of Prambanan to the east.&nbsp; Both charge foreigners in USD; at a rate some 10 times that which the locals are charged.&nbsp; Grrr.<BR><BR>Borobudur is a huge stepped pyramid-like temple built around 860AD.&nbsp; It was abandoned some 200 years later, and covered by ash from the nearby Merapi volcano.&nbsp; Eventually the Dutch discovered it in the late 19th century, and began a massive restoration project (25 million USD) which was only completed around 1975.&nbsp; Around the walls of the four steps of the pyramid are some 4 kilometres of pictures carved into the volcanic rock.&nbsp; These tell several of the popular Buddhist stories, from the enlightenment of Buddha through to a story of how a bull saved other animals from a monkey’s torments.&nbsp; The top of the pyramid is covered with many chedi’s, most of which contain a Buddha statue, in one of his various [subtle] poses.<BR><BR>Indonesians flock to the monument, and by the time the sun has risen, it is crawling with people; mostly school children.&nbsp; We can’t decide whether they come to see the monument, or to see the tourists.&nbsp; Whilst we were clambering around, we were approached every 10 minutes by someone asking us if they could have a picture taken with us.&nbsp; When we agreed, suddenly all their friends would appear from around the corner, screeching with excitement, and all wanting an individual picture taken.&nbsp; Funnily enough, Indonesians don’t seem to be natural photographers; more than half the pictures had a thumb or camera strap in the way.&nbsp; One fellow was even trying to take the picture with the camera pointing the wrong way; we felt we had to save him from certain blindness by pointing this out.&nbsp; (Rather tricky given our entire command of Indonesian only includes Yes, Good morning and Thank You).<BR><BR>Our trip to Prambanan was less hassling, and almost as interesting.&nbsp; This time we watched the information video before traipsing around the monument; which turned out to be the better order of events.&nbsp; Like Borobudur, Prambanan was built around the 9th century, abandoned and then restored by the Dutch.&nbsp; The before and after pictures are most impressive.&nbsp; The Dutch took a pile of rocks, and managed to reconstruct 8 gigantic temples, complete with relief carvings and statues.&nbsp; Prambanan is a tribute to the three Hindu gods Shiva, Brahma and Vishnu, and their respective steeds. (Each of the six entities has their own temple, with their statue inside).&nbsp; Around the walls of two of the temples is the famous story of Ramayana, and that of Krishna on the third.&nbsp; All in all most impressive; but you will see that from the pictures.&nbsp; Our only complaint is the billions of hawkers persistently trying to sell you water at inflated prices.&nbsp; In the end it was only the guitarists at the exit who trapped my tourist dollar.<BR><BR>After visiting the temple we went to see the Ramayana ballet.&nbsp; During the dry season this is held outdoors with the temples as a backdrop, but unfortunately that only begins in May, so we watched it indoors.&nbsp; The ballet was very good, and included some 250 cast members dancing around in colourful costumes, re-enacting battles, and with the hero shooting the villains with his bow and arrow (actually).&nbsp; Sad that there were only 14 people watching the performance.<BR>Whilst in Yogyakarta, we took the opportunity to order roasted duck from our favourite restaurant – Supermans.&nbsp; Throughout SE Asia these are commonly displayed whole; including head and feet.&nbsp; This is exactly how they arrived on our plates, the head lying on one side and the feet on the other, whilst the glazed eye stared at us balefully.&nbsp; Fortunately our duck was served with lettuce, and the owners stared in amazement as we cut off the head and feet, and hid them from view under the lettuce.&nbsp; “Weird foreigners” they must have been thinking.<BR>During another meal we ordered chicken, and were dismayed to be served not only the head, but the internal organs too, carefully separated and cooked on our plate.&nbsp; Yuck!<BR><BR>Serving vulgarities aside, duck and chicken in Indonesia is very good, if rather skinny.&nbsp; Beef is pretty hard to come by, expensive and not much good.&nbsp; Fish on the other hand is everywhere, and excellent.&nbsp; It comes in many varieties, from grilled and fried through to curried and is definitely not to be missed.<BR><BR>The Indonesian archipelago is basically a long string (5000km) of volcanoes.&nbsp; Every island has at least one, and quite a few are still active.&nbsp; So, a visit of Indonesia wouldn’t be complete without visiting a volcano, and the [semi-active] volcano of Mount Bromo in East-Java is the one most travellers go to see, ourselves included.<BR><BR>Malang is a major town halfway up the slopes of Mount Bromo, giving it a pleasant cool climate, and making it a good place to take a tour up the mountain from.&nbsp; You can also get there by train; an added bonus.&nbsp; Our arrival in Malang seemed to elicit a mixed response from the locals.&nbsp; As we busied ourselves riding to and fro in becaks (peddle powered rickshaws) organising a tour up the mountain, some rushed across the road to shake our hands, whilst other pointed from their cafes and laughed, saying something about “Americanos”.&nbsp; We were even a victim of a drive by “F**k you” – two youths drove by us on a motorbike, swearing at us as they passed.&nbsp; It’s the first bit of anti-Westerner sentiment we’ve encountered; the vast majority of people are quite friendly and welcoming.<BR><BR>Our tour up to Mt. Bromo left at 2am, and we spent several hours climbing windy mountain roads in our hired minibus to reach the Penanjakan viewpoint on the crater rim, just before sunrise.&nbsp; For every 500 metres we climbed, the temperature dropped by 3°C, so by the time we reached the viewpoint at 2770 metres, the air was pretty crisp.&nbsp; Suddenly lugging our polartechs around SE Asia didn’t seem like such a bad idea.<BR><BR>&gt;From the Penanjakan viewpoint you look over the “Mt. Bromo” crater, which actually contains three smaller peaks that rise out of a “sea” of volcanic ash.&nbsp; Mt Bromo is actually one of these smaller peaks, and actively spews steam.&nbsp; Behind the Mt Bromo crater, lies a far larger and more active volcano called Mt. Semeru.&nbsp; As we were waiting for the sun to rise we saw a huge pillar of fire shoot from the top of Semeru into the night sky.&nbsp; Wow!&nbsp; What a sight.&nbsp; That really made our day.<BR><BR>After taking some obligatory sunrise pictures, we drove down over the “sea” to the foot of Mt Bromo, and took a short walk up the stairs to the summit.&nbsp; From the summit you can look straight down into the active crater, and watch the clouds of white steam rise into the air.&nbsp; The base of the crater is covered with yellow sulphur crystals, and the air reeks of sulphur dioxide.&nbsp; A pretty amazing experience.<BR><BR>We caught the executive train back to Jakarta that evening.&nbsp; The trip is pretty comfortable, but the conductors are pretty sneaky with the way they serve food.&nbsp; Your ticket includes tea and a meal, similar to what you would expect when flying.&nbsp; However, just before they dish out the free meals, they walk up and down the isles with trays of steaming soup and steak, handing it out to whoever wants.&nbsp; Thinking this was manna from heaven I tucked in merrily; until the bill arrived with my tray of free food!&nbsp; Luckily it wasn’t too expensive.<BR><BR>People describe Jakarta as the big Durian (a fruit) of Indonesia.&nbsp; Sticky and sweet, some people love being at the centre of the action, others hate the pollution and crowds.&nbsp; Whilst the air pollution is pretty bad, the tourist street can almost be described as quaint, and is quite pleasant.&nbsp;&nbsp; Becaks have been banned from the city, and in their place orange three wheeled motorised rickshaws zoom up and down the streets.&nbsp; Personally I think that travelling by becak is probably safer; but the tip we took from the hotel to the train station was still pretty fun.<BR><BR>Whilst in Jakarta we met a most interesting German engineer named Gerd.&nbsp; On contract building a paper mill in China, Gerd had come to Indonesia for some R&amp;R with his wife, and to renew his visa.&nbsp; As we got chatting, we discovered that Gerd and his wife had spent 2½ years motorcycling around Africa, travelling through Rwanda, Zaire, Namibia, South Africa, Mozambique and Tanzania.&nbsp; They particularly enjoyed the Garden Route; so we had plenty to talk about.&nbsp; Gerd enthralled us with tales of visiting villages and being invited to lunch three times (in one day), being swarmed by the whole village wanting to see the strange white people on the motorbikes, and how they managed to get across the whole of Zaire spending only 2 USD on food (a two week trip!).&nbsp; Gerd and his wife have also motorbiked around South America, and we got some exciting pointers on where to go when we visit there later this year.<BR><BR>Taman Mini is a cultural park build in 1975 that contains a traditional house from each of the regions of Indonesia, set around a lake with small islands that represent those of the archipelago.&nbsp; There is everything from churches, mosques and temples through to miniature recreations of Borobudur, a bird park and an IMAX theatre.&nbsp; Plus, if you are Indonesian, it is a good place to meet (and photograph) tourists, which is what happened to us when we went there the next day with Gerd.&nbsp; It turns out that it is even worse if you are single; Gerd told us how the night before at the bar, he had had an unending stream of young Indonesia women come to talk to him.&nbsp; Most seem to have the goal of marrying a Westerner and going back to Europe with them.<BR><BR>The taxi ride back seemed to take much longer than usual, and when Gerd pulled out his map, he discovered that the driver had taken us right around the city on the way home, almost double the distance of the more direct route we had taken getting there in the morning.&nbsp; Gerd argued with the driver, pointing to the route we should have taken.&nbsp; The driver played dumb, and eventually we handed him the faire we had paid for the shorter trip, and got out the taxi.&nbsp; You’ve always got to be on you toes, especially when you walk around looking like a tourist money bank. <BR><BR>Unlike most countries in the world, Indonesia’s airline industry is booming.&nbsp; In part this is because other countries airlines have been forced to ground planes; meaning the Indonesian’s can rent them at rock bottom prices.&nbsp; Currently there are 22 airlines, with a further 4 seeking approval to start flying.&nbsp; The net result for us, is that competition has driven the prices down so much that it is sometimes cheaper to fly than take the bus!&nbsp; When faced with a 30 hour bus journey or a 1½ hour plane flight to Padang in Sumatra, for roughly the same price, the decision wasn’t very hard.&nbsp; <BR></P>
<P>So, the next day saw us catching the airport bus to Jakarta International, which, due to all the airlines is a huge complex spanning three terminals.&nbsp; It was only due to Wendy’s sharp eye that we spotted the airline we were flying with, and managed to get out at the right terminal.&nbsp; Before the end of the day we were jetting our way away from Java to the less developed island of Sumatra.&nbsp; But I’ll leave those adventures for the next exciting instalment.&nbsp; Java turned out to be a pleasent place to visit, and the concerns of SARS or anti-Westerner sentiment remained pretty much that; just concerns.</P></span><!-- End_Module_433 -->
