<I>Beauty, Traffic jams and the return to humidity<BR></I>By David<BR><BR>When we arrived in Bangkok, early in the morning having caught the night bus from Chiang Mai to the Northern Bus Terminal, there were two things that assaulted us instantly.&nbsp; The first was the humidity, and the second the tuk-tuk and taxi drivers.&nbsp; They swarmed us, trying to get us to use their services to get into Bangkok.&nbsp; The first quoted us 400B!&nbsp; By now we have learnt a little about the price difference between personalised and public service; our basic motto being: “If they have to come to you to sell it, it can’t be a good enough deal for people to seek out.”&nbsp; Thus, we decided to politely decline (every 10 seconds) and try to find the more regular busses – rather tricky when you can’t read any of the signs #-).&nbsp; Eventually we found the normal busses, and, after putting some of the locals into hysterics with our pronunciation of where we were trying to go, got onto the right bus and were transported safely to Khao San road.&nbsp; For the princely sum of 7B.&nbsp; Welcome to Bangkok – caveat emptor (“let the buyer beware”).<BR><BR>The guide book describes Bangkok as “ [full of] noise, pollution, and some of the worst traffic jams in Asia.&nbsp; Add annual floods and sticky weather, and it’s hardly surprising that many people develop an interesting dislike for the place.”&nbsp; This is all true; and Bangkok is a far cry from Chiang Mai as a holiday destination.&nbsp; However, there were several things about the city that stood out as exemplary, and it is definitely worth stopping here for a few days whilst in transit.<BR><BR>As the capital, Bangkok has all of the official institutions of Thailand, and quite possibly the best temples and palaces on offer.&nbsp; The most well known of these is the Grand Palace; whose complex also houses the famous Temple of the Emerald Budda.&nbsp; You can rent a “Personal Audio Guide” on Sony discman which tells you about the various things to be seen during your walking tour of the complex.&nbsp; The temple complex is the royal place of worship for the king, and the current line of kings have been playing a game of one-up-man-ship – building and renovating – since the capital was moved to Bangkok some 250 odd years ago.<BR><BR>Suffice it to say that the results are quite astounding, as we hope the attached pictures will show.&nbsp; Everything glints and gleams in amazing size and detail, and the dogma of Buddism comes alive in all the sculptures, statues, buildings and paintings.&nbsp; We had been to a lecture on Buddist art earlier in the day at the National Museum, and it was satisfying that at least some of the religious icons began to made sense to us.<BR><BR>The only disappointing item was the Emerald Budda itself, which, even though it occupies the central and most impressive hall, it’s actually rather small and, er, boring.&nbsp; I’ll be coming back as a worm for saying that, but there you have it.<BR><BR>Bangkok’s saving grace is the large river and many canals that run through it.&nbsp; A regular boat taxi service runs along these, and this is a scenic and traffic avoiding way to commute from place to place.&nbsp; Many of the major sights are visible from the river – making it a rather good way to get a good tour of the city.&nbsp; We did this on our second day in Bangkok, visiting the central train station to get bus tickets (we were touted) along the way.&nbsp; The trip on the river is most pleasant, and only a little more expensive than the bus.&nbsp; The river front is quite a sight – crumbling Chinatown dumps next to luxury hotels next to beautiful temples.&nbsp; Besides the public river taxis, the river teams with private taxis (which look like gondolas with naked truck engines lashed to the rear), floating restaurants and massive barges lashed together being towed by tiny little boats (reminiscent of the little engine that could: “I think I can, I think I can…”)&nbsp; During the walking part of our trip we also passed through an area with the most amazing number of little scrap shops selling all manner of “reclaimed” engine parts and metal bars, another where the whole street comprised of ceramic plumbing shops, and ate an outrageously priced pizza.<BR><BR>Thailand has had a series of capitals during is time as a kingdom.&nbsp; Prior to Bangkok, the capital was slightly further north along the river at Ayuthaya, until it was destroyed by the attacking Burmese in 1767.&nbsp; We took a one day minibus tour to see the ruins that remain, which is probably the best way to do things given that you can recover in air-conditioned comfort while travelling between sites.&nbsp; <BR><BR>The scale of the ruins is quite staggering, and they must really have been a sight during their heyday.&nbsp; Amongst the more interesting things are the many giant chedi (stuppas), built either to commemorate a victory, or hold the remains of Budda or the king (the latter being more likely to be authentic).&nbsp; The style of chedi has changed over the years, and differs amongst regions in South East Asia, and Ayuthaya has a nice selection (albeit that they are somewhat worse for wear).&nbsp; There are also many reclining (lying down) Buddas – the scale of which is quite awesome – it is quite easy to be dwarfed by a toenail.<BR><BR>Interestingly enough, it is often the little things that really impress on one the feeling of being a stranger in a strange land.&nbsp; Here is our list of the top ten for South Africa’s in Thailand.<BR><BR></P>
<OL>
<LI>Thailand is so safe (or perhaps South Africa is so dangerous?!).&nbsp; You never have to think twice about walking around after dark.&nbsp; Street vendors openly display their day’s takings in a cup on their counter top.&nbsp; People leave their bicycles propped against the sidewalk whilst shopping.&nbsp; It is thoroughly pleasant. 
<LI>The feeling of complete illiteracy.&nbsp; Thai script is so completely different that you can’t even begin to recognise words or puzzle out meanings.&nbsp; The length of the word hardly seems to bear any correlation with the complexity of the idea.&nbsp;&nbsp; On several occasions we have found ourselves unable to figure out which bus or road to take, or unable to use the telephone.&nbsp; Thank goodness for our guide book! 
<LI>Ubiquitous chilli.&nbsp; Chilli seems to be the base ingredient of all foods.&nbsp; Three kinds of chilli condiments (red, green and dried – which I discovered by taking a large sniff – ouch!) are served with meals rather than salt and pepper.&nbsp; Mild means hot, hot means instant emergency milk treatment, and no chilli very seldom actually means no chilli.&nbsp; However, once you get into the “no chilli”, there are many Thai dishes that are fantastic, and we have definitely enjoyed our culinary experience. 
<LI>Meals are always delivered when they are ready, rather than to everyone simultaneously.&nbsp; At the cheaper restaurants this has sometimes resulted in the first person finishing their meal by the time the second receives theirs. 
<LI>Traffic pandemonium.&nbsp; Thai traffic has to be seen to be believed.&nbsp; The direction of traffic on double lane highways often reverses over intersections – you really need to watch those direction arrows or you could be in big danger.&nbsp; Scooters weave in and out of traffic, people gaily drive on the wrong side of the road, most roads are one way – sometimes meaning you need to squeeze down a tiny alley to get to your destination. 
<LI>Electrical wiring.&nbsp; Most of Thailand only has two pronged unearthed plugs, no plugs have switches, all wiring seems to be external (even in new buildings) and electrification seems to have happened one house at a time, with each separate wire attached in birds’ nest style to the electricity poles.&nbsp; It’s a small wonder the whole place hasn’t burnt down due to electrical fires. 
<LI>Copyright laws seem non existent.&nbsp; Road side stalls sell obviously pirated music and computer CDs for minimal prices (some seem to only stock inkjet printed copies of the CD covers – I presume you select the data you want and they burn your own custom CD on the spot.)&nbsp; Designer clothes, shoes and watch ripoffs abound.&nbsp; All the guesthouses show nightly movies on VCD – the [poor] quality and recency of which suggest they were created using a handheld camera inside the cinema. 
<LI>Fruit shakes!&nbsp; Tropical fruit is delicious and plentiful, and no meal is complete without an iced fruit shake smoothie.&nbsp; Mangoes, bananas, melons and coconuts abound; although the watermelons are really small.&nbsp; Apples and lemons seem to be foreign species – I keep getting half a lime with my meal when I am expecting a lemon.&nbsp; And nothing is vanilla flavoured; they seem to use nuts as a base here, not vanilla. 
<LI>You are never offered a second drink at a restaurant.&nbsp; However, if you hang around long enough reading the paper (most restaurants have up to date, free newspapers – in English – for customers to read), they will bring you a complementary glass of water. 
<LI>Energy consciousness.&nbsp; You hardly ever see a non florescent light bulb; hot showers are unusual; the power in hotel rooms is controlled by your room keytag – when you leave it switches off.&nbsp; We even read a newspaper article where they are considering reducing the national speed limit to 80km/h to save on fuel consumption.&nbsp; The West has some catching up to do. </LI></OL>
<P>Tonight (Friday), we are on a bus and off to the little island of Ko Samui - on the East coast of Southern Thailand.&nbsp; Time to laze around on the beach and do some sunbathing. </P></span><!-- End_Module_426 -->
