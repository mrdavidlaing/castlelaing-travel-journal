<I>Lakes, hot springs and orang-utans.</I> <BR>By David </P>
<P>Lake Toba is the largest lake in South East Asia, occuping the caldera of a giant volcano that collapsed on itself after a massive eruption (to put Krakatua to shame) some 100,000 years ago. It covers an area of about 1700 square kilometres, at a depth of around 450m. In the middle is an island, Pulau Samosir, about the same size as Singapore. Since the lake is about 800m above sea level, the climate is pleasantly cool.</P>
<P>Tuk-tuk is a peninsula of the island that comprises almost solely of tourist guest houses. This was our first stop in North Sumatra, after a gruelling 16 hour bus journey (averaging 30km/h!) and a short ferry ride. Like the rest of Indonesia, Tuk-tuk is suffering from a severe lack of tourists, and wondering the deserted streets past closed hotels and abandoned shops was quite saddening.</P>
<P>Here and there however there were small pockets that still seemed to be thriving. Being so totally geared towards tourists, everyone was extremely friendly, and had a fantastically good command of English. Accommodation was the cheapest and best value we have found anywhere in SE Asia; we had a lovely room overlooking the lake, with balcony, hot water and western toilet for only Rp30,000 (ZAR 30) per night.</P>
<P>Just below our balcony was a pool containing massive koi fish, and there was a diving board into the lake off to the one side. Swimming in the lake was quite pleasant, although we found the diving board a bit whippety, and every now and again your foot would brush a piece of weed (well that is what we hope it was!)</P>
<P>One day we hired a scooter and took off around the island to visit the hot springs. Hooting around all the corners just like real Indonesians we zoomed along through rice fields, over rickety wooden bridges and around belching busses and trucks. The most distinctive features of the landscape are the family tombs that sit in most fields. Often a tomb will contain a miniature church on its top, or a tall pole with a Batak house on top. It definitely seemed to be a case of being better that the Jones' in death. The area around Toba is Christian, and the area is dotted with churches. These are churches as you have never seen before, incorporating the sweeping roofs and ornate carving of the Batak people.</P>
<P>The hot springs occupy a scar in the slopes of the lake where no plant life grows. Where the scar touches the lake, the water turns a brilliant shade of tourquoise, making a rather spectacular site. We rode our motorbike up to a rather grotty set of buildings at the base of the springs, and then took a short walk to the up to the source. On the way we passed many pipes running alongside the path; the people of this area always have hot water.</P>
<P>The source of the hot springs is really spectacular, and completely unspoilt with any buildings or paths. The approach up the final valley is quite precarious; the air reaks of sulphur, the stream at the bottom contains boiling water, and at intervals jets of steam shoot out of the rocks. At the end of the valley is a waterfall of boiling water, that falls into a pool surrounded by rocks adorned with sulphur crystals. Amazing.</P>
<P>Even though Indonesia has recently passed anti-piracy laws, piracy is still rife. Numerous stalls sell software and video CDs; in fact even the big department stores sell pirated DVDs. As you can imagine this is really cheap a DVD sells for Rp10,000. As a result the home theater has really taken off in Indonesia. In fact we saw almost no commercial theatres; they must find it difficult to compete when pirated titles are released sometimes months before the official launch. At any rate, we were lured into one such home theatre stocked with many pirated titles and enjoyed watching some of the latest releases such as "Chicago". We also watched "American Pie 3", a title which the South African public has fortunately been shielded against.</P>
<P>After Lake Toba, our next stop was the orangutan rehabilitation sanctuary at Bukit Lawang. Setup in 1973, this is one of the few places in the world where the public can see orang-utans in the wild. In all there are some 5,000 orang-utans (an orang is an adult or person in Indonesian) living living in the dense jungle around Bukit Lawang. We were expecting Bukit Lawang to be a sleepy little town. However it seems that it is a popular weekend edition destination for the locals from Medan; and we unfortunately chose the weekend to arrive. After a long and arduous bus journey, we only arrived after dark. Fortunately that we had met a guide who was able to find us a room [at half price - what he called the 'tourist' price?], for the place was teaming with Indonesians singing karaoke at the top of their lungs. Unfortunately the guide then spent the next half an our giving us the hard sell on a trek for the next day, until we eventually agreed to meet him the next day early in the morning.</P>
<P>The next morning when we met our guide, it turned out that he had arranged for his brother to take us, as he already had customers for the day. We were a little miffed and felt somewhat manipulated; however his brother did turn out to be quite a good guide. On our walk we saw (and heard) gibbons, some Makasaw monkeys, and five orangutans. Unfortunately these were generally in the tops of the trees, so we saw more of the fruit bits they kept dropping on our heads than of them. We were forced to flee from the only orangutan we saw on the ground; apparently they get quite aggressive when protecting their young, and this one was definitely moving towards us in a menacing manner. In all it was definitely a worthwhile experience, but I have seen and learnt more about orangutans on the Discovery Channel.</P>
<P>Our final stop in Indonesia was in Medan, where we spent one unpleasant night, and the next day boarded the ferry to Penang in Malaysia (several hours late; in typical Indonesian fashion). In many ways we were glad to be leaving; glad to be getting away from people constantly trying to get money out of us, glad to get away from the awful roads and poor communications structures. Indonesia is definitely a colourful place to visit; but as with too many colours it can sometimes be a little overwhelming. Sadly, with the new restrictive visa regulations and the renewed spate of bomb blasts, it will probably not see as many tourists as the local people may hope. </P></span><!-- End_Module_435 -->
