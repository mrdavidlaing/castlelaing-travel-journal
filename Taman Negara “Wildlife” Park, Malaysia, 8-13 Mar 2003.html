<I>Big Rivers, Big Leaves, Big Game??</I> <BR>By Wendy <BR><BR>Our first 3 nights in Malaysia were spent in Kota Bharu, the capital of the Kelantan province – one of the most Islamic. Here we ate lots of hamburgers (being thoroughly sick of slop on rice or noodles by now – we want our food types separate from each other on our plate), went to a couple of museums and watched a cultural show.<BR><BR>It took us several days back in Malaysia to figure out exactly what was wrong – we had been feeling rather unwelcome, yet people kept on greeting us. Finally, we realised that it was the men who were saying hello and the women who were leering at us from under their head coverings. Probably, the women aren’t that unfriendly, they just don’t speak to other people as a rule – but it made us feel a little dirty and uncovered (although we went nowhere without long pants and shirts with sleeves).<BR><BR>Our first museum was a presentation of some of the Kelantan artworks – weaving, carving, batik (which the whole of South East Asia has borrowed from Indonesia), silver working etc. We even saw some little carved stools with sharp cog-shaped knives that are used for shredding coconut.<BR>The Royal Museum is situated in the old palace. It has hundreds of collections of photos of the current king and queen (from their childhood, to their coronation etc.), shelves and shelves of tea and crockery sets and a room full of gifts from visiting dignitaries. I particularly liked the little (about 20cm long) dragon boats blown intricately from glass. We also got to see the several bedrooms with personal attire, pillows and histories of who painted the room what colour when (Hurrah!?). <BR>The museums aren’t air-conditioned though, so it didn’t take us long to be all museumed out and have to leave to buy something cold.<BR><BR>On our first night in Kota Bharu, we went to the night market. We wandered around and eventually chose a few things that looked edible (and at least half of them were) to eat and drink. We got brave and tried out some bright pink juice that we have seen around – it turns out that it tastes a bit like squeeze-and-drink juice and has “worms” of tofu floating around in it that you can suck up unsuspectingly if you aren’t careful (knocking out your tonsils on their way past). The barbequed chicken bits were pretty good and so where the pancakes (both the beef and banana ones). We even went back to buy some sticky rice and some banana pancakes for our breakfast.<BR><BR>The cultural show gave David an opportunity to show off his amazing Malaysian drumming skills, which he rather enjoyed. We also got to watch an amazingly slow version of Karate Kata and a puppet show. The puppet show was with 2-dimensional characters behind a backlit screen. We didn’t understand the storyline and the puppets did very little besides walk onto and off the screen once – we were a little disappointed. The Malaysian dancing failed to redeem itself – still excruciatingly slow and not even technically interesting. We probably need to get to know a lot more about South East Asian culture before the dancing becomes entertaining.<BR><BR>We tried to buy stamps and to change money whilst in Kota Bharu – what a mission. The queues move SO slowly. I stood in a stinking hot queue in the post office (with less than 10 people in front of me) for nearly an hour. I eventually decided that the main problem was that men are always allowed to push in front of women, and that foreigners are at the bottom of the feeding pile. In addition, no one in the whole of the town changes Thomas Cook traveller’s cheques (except Maybank, but they were on lunch for several hours and we got tired of waiting). We eventually drew money at an ATM – a much better way of getting money around here. Next time, we are only taking an ATM card and a few US Dollars in cash. This is much easier and cheaper than Traveller’s cheques.<BR><BR>Way before the crack of dawn on Monday morning, we were up and off to the train station to catch the Jungle Train down to Jeran Tut. We decided to take the slower day train (it takes more than twice as long) so that we could view the jungle scenery along the way. While we enjoyed travelling along in the middle of wild jungle, I think that 2 or 3 hours would have been enough – 11 was way too much. We had to travel in 3rd class (no other classes on the mail train), which had no air-con or fans, but was pretty comfortable. We were lucky to travel on a cloudy, even rainy day, so it was cool. I however, managed to spend a lot of the time on the train nauseous because of the huge amount of smoking inside the carriage that everyone did. I was also appalled to watch mothers with their children throwing sweet papers and peanut shells all over the train floor. I even saw one child give a paper to his mother, who then threw it under her seat. No wonder the sides of the streets around here are all covered with litter – and why I have trouble finding a bin.<BR><BR>We were entertained on the train by a blind man and the lady with him, who fell asleep periodically, with their mouths wide open. The lady was so thin that she looked like a skull lying there with her sunken eyes and her mouth open. The guy was rather fat and sang loudly while he was awake – smoking like a chimney (he was rather deft at lighting his cigarette and staring blankly out the window).<BR><BR>The train finally pulled into Jeran Tut, where we were greeted by an extremely keen dude who shoved a pamphlet into our hand, offering us a free ride to look at the accommodation he was offering – no commitment. We hummed and hawed a bit and then, in a fit of indecision, went with him. This turned out to be a good decision. We got a reasonable room for the night (with air-con – yay), a free information session on Taman Negara, a free place to store our baggage and sit on our return. Taman Negara is one of Malaysia’s few national parks, an area of what is claimed to be the world’s oldest rainforest situated roughly in the middle of peninsula Malaysia.<BR><BR>His entire operation is very slick. The company owns its own boat ferries, taxis, restaurant, employs its own guides and is extremely reasonably priced. On arrival, you get a map of the park, they get you to and from the park (a 3 hour long boat ride – very tough on the legs since you are sitting on the floor), you can book the same activities and accommodation as the park itself – but at almost half the price. <BR>The accommodation in the park is more upmarket, but extremely expensive and our guide book recommends against it (so did our wonderfully friendly guides – but we took them with a pinch of salt, especially in the beginning), so we decided to stay somewhere in the village across the river from the park. When we got there, we quickly discovered that the first night would be OK, but there was no accommodation available for the next. A 400-strong group of Singaporeans were arriving the next day and had booked up everything everywhere. We booked into a little hovel for an outrageous price for the first night and then went on an earnest search for night 2 (rucksacks make one just have to book in anywhere after a short walk in the blistering sun and hazy humidity). We were lucky to find one of the last 3 huts in town.<BR><BR>On our first night, we booked a night jungle walk with the famous guide – Crazy-Like-Monkey. He is a wonderful guy, full of smart quips and an amazing obsession with the jungle – in particular insects. We saw jungle chopsticks (stick insects), their remote control to turn them back into an insect (press its bum), the centipede whose poison he hasn’t had a chance to test on tourists yet, and back at the restaurant – a butterfly (throw a brick of butter and what do you get?). Crazy-Like-Monkey spent the 2-hour walk teasing us about being frightened of leeches (they come out when it rains), showed us hairy and jumping spiders and even spotted a mouse-deer (smaller than a cane rate) for us – even though it was so cold (less than 35 degC) that most of the animals were in hiding and most of the spiders weren’t home and had gone to MacDonalds down the road.<BR><BR>The next morning, David and I went to the park to explore the famous Canopy Walk – a 45m high walk amongst the ancient trees, over 500m long – the longest in the world. It was a hot, sweaty 1.8km walk through the jungle to get there, but we managed to have the energy to marvel at the huge leaves and interesting greens and blues everywhere. The Canopy Walk is very scary, you have to walk at least 5m apart to prevent too much swaying of the thin planks that join each platform. We enjoyed the new perspective from high up there, but still didn’t see anymore animals or birds.<BR><BR>That afternoon was the anticipated rapid shooting adventure. A group of us were taken up the river (extremely impressively boat handling over shallow rapids) by a long boat to where we each jumped into a tube and floated back down again. The rapids were pretty cool and from up close, I couldn’t see over the next wave coming towards me. We got very wet, but didn’t fall out – which was a relief. Floating down the river, turning around slowly from the current is a great way to experience the huge trees up on the high banks. However, watch out for bottoming out on the rocks. David and I both managed to bang our bums on a hidden rock in the last rapid. Luckily, a sore bruise and painful journey home were the only consequences. The river water is cool enough that for the first time in ages, we almost felt cold in the breeze.<BR><BR></P>
<P>We caught the boat back to Jeran Tut, couldn’t find a single postcard and are sending out this bumper crop of emails before we take the 2:08am express train to Singapore (we are hoping to be shocked by the cleanliness of the city). Given that 400 giggling schoolgirls will be in Taman Negara, it should at least be much quieter. </P></span><!-- End_Module_429 -->
